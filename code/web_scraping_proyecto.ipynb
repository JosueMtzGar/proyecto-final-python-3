      "        Utilizing a quark model characterized by parameters that effectively replicate the masses of ground state hadrons, we illustrate that $(us)$ or $(ds)$ diquarks exhibit greater compactness in comparison to $(ud)$ diquarks. Concretely, the binding energy of the $(us)$ diquark - defined as the diquark's mass minus the combined masses of its individual quarks - is found to be more attractive than that of the $(ud)$ diquark. This heightened attraction present in $(us)$ diquarks could lead to enhanced production of $Œû_c/D$ particles in high-energy pp or ultrarelativistic\n",

For pionic observables, we find that a higher maximum density leads to an enhanced pion yield and a reduced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, while a more effective Pauli blocking generally leads to a slightly suppressed pion yield and an enhanced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, although differences in its implementations do not have a dominating role in the differences among the codes. We specifically investigate the effect of the Coulomb force, and find that it increases the total $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio but reduces the ratio at high pion energies. Using only the results of codes that strictly follow the homework specifications, we find a convergence of the codes in the final charged pion yield ratio to less than $15\\%$, while the uncertainty is expected to be reduced to about $4\\%$ if the same or similar ingredients are incorporated in each code.\n",

      "        We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $Œ±= a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe, and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic\n",

      "        In-medium masses of the light vector $œâ$, $œÅ$ and axial-vector $A_1$ mesons are studied in the magnetized nuclear matter, accounting for the effects of (inverse) magnetic catalysis at finite temperature. The in-medium partial decay widths for the $A_1\\rightarrow œÅœÄ$ channels are studied from the in-medium masses of the initial and the final state particles, by applying a phenomenological Lagrangian to account for the $A_1œÅœÄ$ interaction vertices. The masses are calculated within the QCD sum rule framework, with the medium effects coming through the light quark ($\\sim \\langle \\bar{q}q \\rangle$) and the scalar gluon condensates ($\\sim \\langle G^2 \\rangle$), as well as the light four-quark condensate ($\\sim \\langle \\bar{q}q\\rangle^2 $). The condensates are calculated within the chiral $SU(3)$ model in terms of the medium modified scalar fields: isoscalar $œÉ$, $Œ∂$, isovector $Œ¥$ and the dilaton field $œá$. The effects of magnetic fields are incorporated through the magnetized Dirac sea contribution as well as the Landau energy levels of protons and anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) of the nucleons at finite temperature nuclear matter. The incorporation of the magnetic field through the Dirac sea of nucleons lead to an enhancement (reduction) of the light quark condensates with magnetic field, give rise to the phenomenon of magnetic (inverse) catalysis. The effects of (inverse) magnetic catalysis at finite temperature nuclear matter are studied on the spectral functions and production cross-sections of the neutral $œÅ$ and $A_1$ mesons.

We include different mechanisms of $Œ≥Œ≥\\toŒ≥Œ≥$ scattering, such as double-hadronic photon fluctuations, $t/u$-channel neutral pion exchange or resonance excitations ($Œ≥Œ≥\\to R$) and deexcitation ($R \\to Œ≥Œ≥$). The broad range of (pseudo)rapidities and lower cuts on transverse momenta open a necessity to consider not only dominant box contributions but also other subleading contributions. Here we include low mass resonant $R = œÄ^0$, $Œ∑$, $Œ∑'$ contributions. The resonance contributions give intermediate photon transverse momenta. However, these contributions can be eliminated by imposing windows on di-photon invariant mass. We study and quantify individual box contributions (leptonic, quarkish). The electron/positron boxes dominate at low $M_{Œ≥Œ≥}&lt;1$ GeV di-photon invariant masses. The PbPb$\\to$PbPb$Œ≥Œ≥$ cross section is calculated within equivalent photon approximation in the impact parameter space. Several differential distributions are presented and discussed. We consider four different kinematic regions. We predict cross section in the (mb-b) range for typical ALICE 3 cuts, a few orders of magnitude larger than for the current ATLAS or CMS experiments. We also consider the two-$œÄ^0$ background which can, in principle, be eliminated at the new kinematical range for the ALICE 3 measurements by imposing dedicated cuts on di-photon transverse momentum and\\or so-called vector asymmetry.\n",

We show that the energy is first transported to the soft sector by collinear cascade and then isotropised by elastic scatterings. Remarkably, we find that the jet wake can be well described by a thermal distribution function with angle-dependent temperature.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic process of quark spin polarization induced by magnetic fields. Our findings demonstrate that the spin polarization of quarks is highly sensitive to the interactions between quarks. These interactions can delay the decay of the early spin polarization vector while accelerating the decay of the later spin polarization vector. Specifically, our simulations model the detailed process of how magnetic fields polarize quarks within the fireball by the average spin vector and reveal that quark interactions lead to an acceleration effect on the average spin, causing it to rapidly increase from zero before being rapidly destroyed. Notably, the induced magnetic field in the fireball has an incomplete electromagnetic response effect, and its increase in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field decaying has a delay effect.\n",

We furthermore clarify how the region of phase from which these corrections are borne is situated with respect to that from which the classical corrections arise at relative order $O(g)$.

In this study, we explore two event shape variables to classify events and two elliptic flow variables to regulate the background. Each type of variable can be calculated from either conventional single particles or innovatively particle pairs, resulting in four combinations of event shape and elliptic flow variables. By employing a toy model and the realistic event generator, event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (EBE-AVFD), we discover that the elliptic flow of resonances exhibits correlations with both the background and the potential CME signal, making it unsuitable for background control.

We show that the internal structure, or the wave function distribution of charmonium states plays a significant role, especially when charmonium states are produced by charm quark recombination, leading to the transverse momentum distribution of the $œà(2S)$ meson as half large as that of the $J/œà$ meson. We also consider the dependence of the elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states on internal structures of charmonium states, and find that the wave function effects as well as feed-down contributions are averaged out for elliptic and triangular flow, resulting in similar elliptic and triangular flow for all charmonium states. We investigate further the elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states at low transverse momentum region, and also discuss the quark number scaling of elliptic and triangular flow for charmonium states.\n",

The normalized factorial moments (NFM), $F_{q}$ of the spatial configurations of charged particles in two-dimensional angular ($Œ∑,\\varphi$) phase space are calculated. For a system with dynamic fluctuations due to the characteristic critical behavior near the phase transition, $F_{q}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing bin number or decreasing bin size which indicates self-similar fluctuations. Relating the $q^{\\rm{th}}$ order NFM ($F_{q}$) to the second-order NFM ($F_{2}$), the value of the scaling exponent ($ŒΩ$) is extracted, which indicates the order of the phase transition within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory. The dependence of scaling exponent on the $p_{\\rm{T}}$ bin width will be presented. The measurements are also compared with the corresponding results from the AMPT model and a Toy Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.\n",

The reaction plane fit method is implemented to remove the flow-modulated background with better precision than prior methods. Yields and widths of jet-associated charged-hadron distributions are extracted in three angular bins between the jet axis and the event plane. The event-plane (EP) dependence is further quantified by ratios of the associated yields in different EP bins. No dependence on orientation of the jet axis with respect to the event plane is seen within the uncertainties in the kinematic regime studied. This finding is consistent with a similar experimental observation by ALICE in $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb\n",

We show gauge condensation, which occurs as a consequence of the large density of gluons. To identify this condensation phenomenon, we construct two local gauge-invariant observables that carry the macroscopic zero mode of the gauge condensate. The first order parameter for gauge condensation investigated here is the correlator of the spatial Polyakov loop. We also consider, for the first time, the correlator of the gauge invariant scalar field, associated to the exponent of the Polyakov loop. Using real-time lattice simulations of classical-statistical $SU(2)$ gauge theory, we find gauge condensation on a system-size dependent time scale $t_{\\text{cond}} \\sim L^{1/Œ∂}$ with a universal scaling exponent $Œ∂$. Furthermore, we suggest an effective theory formulation describing the dynamics using one of the order parameters identified. The formation of a condensate at early times may have intriguing implications for the early stages in\n",

      "        . The strong magnetic field induces anisotropy, that is, the quantization of Landau energy levels in phase space. If the magnetic field is strong enough, it will interfere with significant QCD phenomena, such as the generation of dynamic quark mass, which may affect the transport properties of quark matter. The inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moments (AMM) of the quarks at finite density into the NJL model gives rise to additional spin polarization magnetic effects. As the inclusion of AMM of the quarks leads to inverse magnetic catalysis around the transition temperature, we will systematically study the thermodynamic phase transition characteristics of shear viscosity coefficient in QCD media near the phase boundary. The shear viscosity coefficient of the dissipative fluid system can be decomposed into five different components as the strong magnetic field exists. The influences of the order of chiral phase transition and the critical endpoint on dissipative phenomena in such a magnetized medium are quantitatively investigated. It is found that $Œ∑_{1}$, $Œ∑_{2}$, $Œ∑_{3}$, and $Œ∑_{4}$ all increase with temperature. For first-order phase transitions, $Œ∑_{1}$, $Œ∑_{2}$, $Œ∑_{3}$, and $Œ∑_{4}$ exhibit discontinuous characteristics.\n",

It is clear that at RHIC and LHC energies, probabilities of producing electron-positron pairs for impact parameters smaller than Compton-wavelength of electron is greater than one. This means that for small impact parameters where the electric field is strongest multiple electron-positron pair productions is inescapable and it must be included in calculations. In literature, there are number of explanations about the pperp broadening however none of them has included the multi-pair production processes in their calculations. The aim of this paper is to show that electron-positron multi-pair production cross section is large and it can not be ignored in calculations.\n",

The energy of the $Œ≥$-rays can be measured by collecting the ƒåerenkov light in medium induced by the fast electrons generated in Compton scattering or electromagnetic shower of the incident $Œ≥$ ray. Two types of detectors, based on pure water and lead glass as the sensitive material respectively, are designed for the above purpose. The $Œ≥$ response and optical photon propagation in detectors have been simulated based on the electromagnetic and optical processes in Geant4. The inherent energy resolution of $0.022+0.51/E_Œ≥^{1/2}$ for water and $0.002+0.45/E_Œ≥^{1/2}$ for lead glass are obtained. The geometry size of lead glass and water are optimized at $30\\times 30 \\times 30$ cm$^3$ and $60\\times 60 \\times 120$ cm$^3$, respectively, for detecting high energy $Œ≥$-rays at 160 MeV. Hough transform method has been applied to reconstruct the direction of the incident $Œ≥$-rays, giving the ability to distinguish experimentally the high-energy $Œ≥$ rays produced in the reactions on the target from the random background cosmic ray muons.\n",

      "        . There are two main possible models to explain their production mechanism - the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model suggests that the light nuclei are produced from a thermal source, where they are in equilibrium with other species present in the fireball. However, due to the small binding energies, the produced nuclei are not likely to survive the high-temperature conditions of the fireball. The coalescence model tries to explain the production of light nuclei by assuming that they are formed at later stages by the coalescence of protons and neutrons near the kinetic freeze-out surface. The final-state coalescence of nucleons will lead to the mass number scaling of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of light nuclei. This scaling states that the $v_2$ of light nuclei scaled by their respective mass numbers will follow very closely the $v_2$ of nucleons. Therefore, studying the $v_2$ of light nuclei and comparing it with the $v_2$ of protons will help us in understanding their production mechanism.\n",

We show that at late de Sitter time, which corresponds to large proper time and central region in $\\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, the generic behavior for a holographic conformal field theory is given by $\\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$, with $\\varepsilon$, $P_T$ and $P_L$ being the energy density, transverse and longitudinal pressures, respectively. We also establish the general late de Sitter time expansion, which when written in a suitable basis, systematically determines both the early proper time behavior and the behavior at large distance from the beam axis at any fixed proper time in the Minkowski frame. Particularly, $\\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$ is also generically realized at early proper time. The late de Sitter time expansion is also consistent with the hydrodynamic expansion at intermediate times.\n",

However, despite important developments in the last years, a description of the real-time evolution of QCD jets inside a medium is still far from complete. In our previous work, we have explored quantum technologies as a promising alternative theoretical laboratory to simulate jet evolution in QCD matter, to overcome inherent technical difficulties in present calculations. Here, we extend our previous investigation from the single particle to the multiple particle Fock spaces, taking into account gluon production. Based on the light-front Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multi-particle jet probe in the presence of a stochastic color background. Using the quantum simulation algorithm, we show the medium-induced modification to the jet evolution in both the momentum broadening and gluon production.\n",

We find that the nucleonic evolution of the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collision</span> and the nucleonic observables in these codes do not completely converge, but that the differences among the codes can be understood as being due to several reasons: the basic differences between BUU and QMD models in the representation of the phase-space distributions, computational differences in the mean-field evaluation, and differences in the adopted strategies for the Pauli blocking in the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collision</span> integrals. For pionic observables, we find that a higher maximum density leads to an enhanced pion yield and a reduced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, while a more effective Pauli blocking generally leads to a slightly suppressed pion yield and an enhanced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, although differences in its implementations do not have a dominating role in the differences among the codes. We specifically investigate the effect of the Coulomb force, and find that it increases the total $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio but reduces the ratio at high pion energies. Using only the results of codes that strictly follow the homework specifications, we find a convergence of the codes in the final charged pion yield ratio to less than $15\\%$, while the uncertainty is expected to be reduced to about $4\\%$ if the same or similar ingredients are incorporated in each code.\n",

In order to investigate, how such an effective description emerges from the underlying microscopic dynamics we calculate the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes of linear response in the sound channel from a first-principle calculation in kinetic theory. We do this with a new approach wherein we discretize the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collision</span> kernel to directly calculate eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the evolution operator. This allows us to study the Green's functions at any point in the complex frequency space. Our study focuses on scalar theory with quartic interaction and we find that the analytic structure of Green's functions in the complex plane is far more complicated than just poles or cuts which is a first step towards an equivalent study in QCD kinetic theory.\n",

First, the one-loop gluon polarization tensor is obtained in the presence of an external, constant, and homogeneous magnetic field using the Schwinger proper time formalism in Euclidean space. The gluon propagator is computed from the gluon polarization tensor, and it is used to calculate the dielectric permittivity in the presence of the magnetic field in the static limit. The modified dielectric permittivity is then used to compute the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span> quarkonium complex potential. We find that the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span> quarkonium complex potential is anisotropic in nature, which depends on the angle between the quark-antiquark ($Q\\bar{Q}$) dipole axis and the direction of the magnetic field. We discuss the effect of the magnetic field strength and the angular orientation of the dipole on the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span> quarkonium potential. We discuss how the magnetic field influences the thermal widths of quarkonium states. Further, we also discuss the limitation of the strong-field approximation as done in literature in the light of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">ion</span> observables, as the effect of the magnetic field is very nominal to the quarkonium potential.\n",

       "        We perform a systematic study of dilepton emission in a hot QCD medium based on three different scenarios of chiral mixing, each of which yields a characteristic structure in the vector spectral function.

We demonstrate that the low-temperature theorem of chiral mixing extrapolated toward a chiral crossover, often used in the literature, leads to critical shortcomings: the inadequacy of width broadening, and a substantial overestimate of the dilepton yield maximized around the invariant mass of $M = 1.2$ GeV. The proper prescription offers a milder yet sizable increase in the window of $1.1 &lt; M &lt; 1.4$ GeV as the direct signature of chiral symmetry restoration.\n",

       "        We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $Œ±= a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate.

       "        In-medium masses of the light vector $œâ$, $œÅ$ and axial-vector $A_1$ mesons are studied in the magnetized nuclear matter, accounting for the effects of (inverse) magnetic catalysis at finite temperature. The in-medium partial decay widths for the $A_1\\rightarrow œÅœÄ$ channels are studied from the in-medium masses of the initial and the final state particles, by applying a phenomenological Lagrangian to account for the $A_1œÅœÄ$ interaction vertices. The masses are calculated within the QCD sum rule framework, with the medium effects coming through the light quark ($\\sim \\langle \\bar{q}q \\rangle$) and the scalar gluon condensates ($\\sim \\langle G^2 \\rangle$), as well as the light four-quark condensate ($\\sim \\langle \\bar{q}q\\rangle^2 $). The condensates are calculated within the chiral $SU(3)$ model in terms of the medium modified scalar fields: isoscalar $œÉ$, $Œ∂$, isovector $Œ¥$ and the dilaton field $œá$. The effects of magnetic fields are incorporated through the magnetized Dirac sea contribution as well as the Landau energy levels of protons and anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) of the nucleons at finite temperature nuclear matter. The incorporation of the magnetic field through the Dirac sea of nucleons lead to an enhancement (reduction) of the light quark condensates with magnetic field, give rise to the phenomenon of magnetic (inverse) catalysis. The effects of (inverse) magnetic catalysis at finite temperature nuclear matter are studied on the spectral functions and production cross-sections of the neutral $œÅ$ and $A_1$ mesons.

The broad range of (pseudo)rapidities and lower cuts on transverse momenta open a necessity to consider not only dominant box contributions but also other subleading contributions. Here we include low mass resonant $R = œÄ^0$, $Œ∑$, $Œ∑'$ contributions. The resonance contributions give intermediate photon transverse momenta. However, these contributions can be eliminated by imposing windows on di-photon invariant mass. We study and quantify individual box contributions (leptonic, quarkish). The electron/positron boxes dominate at low $M_{Œ≥Œ≥}&lt;1$ GeV di-photon invariant masses. The PbPb$\\to$PbPb$Œ≥Œ≥$ cross section is calculated within equivalent photon approximation in the impact parameter space. Several differential distributions are presented and discussed. We consider four different kinematic regions. We predict cross section in the (mb-b) range for typical ALICE 3 cuts, a few orders of magnitude larger than for the current ATLAS or CMS experiments. We also consider the two-$œÄ^0$ background which can, in principle, be eliminated at the new kinematical range for the ALICE 3 measurements by imposing dedicated cuts on di-photon transverse momentum and\\or so-called vector asymmetry.\n",

To better understand the underlying production mechanism, cold nuclear matter effects, and influence from the quark-gluon plasma, baseline measurements are also performed in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($p$--A) <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span>. The inclusive $\\rm{J}/œà$ measurement has contributions from both prompt and non-prompt productions. The prompt $\\rm{J}/œà$ is produced directly from the hadronic interactions or via feed-down from directly produced higher charmonium states, whereas non-prompt $\\rm{J}/œà$ comes from the decay of beauty hadrons. In experiments, $\\rm{J}/œà$ is reconstructed through its electromagnetic decays to lepton pairs, in either $e^{+}+e^{-}$ or $Œº^{+}+Œº^{-}$ decay channels. In this work, for the first time, machine learning techniques are implemented to separate the prompt and non-prompt dimuon pairs from the background to obtain a better identification of the $\\rm{J}/œà$ signal for different production modes. The study has been performed in $pp$ <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span> at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ and 13 TeV simulated using PYTHIA8. Machine learning models such as XGBoost and LightGBM are explored. The models could achieve up to 99\\% prediction accuracy. The transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) and rapidity ($y$) differential measurements of inclusive, prompt, and non-prompt $\\rm{J}/œà$, its multiplicity dependence, and the $p_{\\rm T}$ dependence of fraction of non-prompt $\\rm{J}/œà$ ($f_{\\rm B}$) are shown. These results are compared to experimental findings wherever possible.\n",

       "        There has been significant interest in recent years in studying the spin polarization of hyperons in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">ion</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span>. However, describing the dynamic spin polarization of quarks in quark-gluon plasma fireballs in detail presents a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a phenomenological investigation of the dynamical spin polarization of quarks induced by the magnetic field at the pre-thermal stage in <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">ion</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span> using the recently developed theoretical tool of chiral kinetic theory. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic process of quark spin polarization induced by magnetic fields. Our findings demonstrate that the spin polarization of quarks is highly sensitive to the interactions between quarks. These interactions can delay the decay of the early spin polarization vector while accelerating the decay of the later spin polarization vector. Specifically, our simulations model the detailed process of how magnetic fields polarize quarks within the fireball by the average spin vector and reveal that quark interactions lead to an acceleration effect on the average spin, causing it to rapidly increase from zero before being rapidly destroyed. Notably, the induced magnetic field in the fireball has an incomplete electromagnetic response effect, and its increase in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field decaying has a delay effect.\n",

The radiation pattern of jets formed from <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span> quarks as they traverse the QGP exhibits a particularly interesting structure due to the interplay of two competing effects: the suppression of small-angle radiation, also known as the ``dead-cone'' effect, and the enhancement of emitted gluons by medium-induced radiation. In this Letter, we propose a new observable, based on the energy correlator approach to jet substructure, which will allow us to disentangle the two scales associated to these two phenomena and to determine under which conditions the dead-cone is filled by medium-induced radiation. Combined with the forthcoming high-statistics measurements of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span>-flavor jets, this work provides a novel tool to unravel the dynamics of the QGP.\n",

To alleviate this background, the event shape selection (ESS) technique categorizes <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collision</span> events according to their shapes and projects the CME observables to a class of events with minimal flow. In this study, we explore two event shape variables to classify events and two elliptic flow variables to regulate the background. Each type of variable can be calculated from either conventional single particles or innovatively particle pairs, resulting in four combinations of event shape and elliptic flow variables. By employing a toy model and the realistic event generator, event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (EBE-AVFD), we discover that the elliptic flow of resonances exhibits correlations with both the background and the potential CME signal, making it unsuitable for background control. Through the EBE-AVFD simulations of Au+Au <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span> at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV with various input scenarios, we ascertain that the optimal ESS strategy for background control entails utilizing the single-particle elliptic flow in conjunction with the event shape variable based on particle pairs.\n",

Starting from the evaluation of charmonia transverse momentum distributions and yields, we calculate elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states based on the coalescence model.

We also consider the dependence of the elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states on internal structures of charmonium states, and find that the wave function effects as well as feed-down contributions are averaged out for elliptic and triangular flow, resulting in similar elliptic and triangular flow for all charmonium states. We investigate further the elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states at low transverse momentum region, and also discuss the quark number scaling of elliptic and triangular flow for charmonium states.\n",

       "        Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that at sufficiently high temperature ($T$) and/or baryon chemical potential ($Œº_B$), the state of matter is in the form of quarks and gluons, which are no longer confined within hadrons.

The goal of relativistic <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">ion</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collision</span> experiments is to create such a hot and dense state of matter and study its properties. Measurements of identified particle spectra in Au+Au <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span> provide information on the bulk properties, such as integrated yield ($dN/dy$), average transverse momenta ($\\langle p_T \\rangle$), particle ratios, and freeze-out parameters of the medium produced. The systematic study of bulk properties sheds light on the particle production mechanism in these <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span>. Also, the centrality dependence of the freeze-out parameters provides an opportunity to explore the QCD phase diagram.\n",

The study of scaling behavior of multiplicity fluctuations in geometrical configurations in multiparticle production can be performed using the factorial moments and recognized in terms of a phenomenon referred to as intermittency. In this contribution, the analysis of the factorial moment is presented for the multiplicity distributions of charged particles produced in Pb$-$Pb <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span> at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV, recorded with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The normalized factorial moments (NFM), $F_{q}$ of the spatial configurations of charged particles in two-dimensional angular ($Œ∑,\\varphi$) phase space are calculated. For a system with dynamic fluctuations due to the characteristic critical behavior near the phase transition, $F_{q}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing bin number or decreasing bin size which indicates self-similar fluctuations. Relating the $q^{\\rm{th}}$ order NFM ($F_{q}$) to the second-order NFM ($F_{2}$), the value of the scaling exponent ($ŒΩ$) is extracted, which indicates the order of the phase transition within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory. The dependence of scaling exponent on the $p_{\\rm{T}}$ bin width will be presented. The measurements are also compared with the corresponding results from the AMPT model and a Toy Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.\n",

The reaction plane fit method is implemented to remove the flow-modulated background with better precision than prior methods. Yields and widths of jet-associated charged-hadron distributions are extracted in three angular bins between the jet axis and the event plane. The event-plane (EP) dependence is further quantified by ratios of the associated yields in different EP bins. No dependence on orientation of the jet axis with respect to the event plane is seen within the uncertainties in the kinematic regime studied.

We show gauge condensation, which occurs as a consequence of the large density of gluons. To identify this condensation phenomenon, we construct two local gauge-invariant observables that carry the macroscopic zero mode of the gauge condensate. The first order parameter for gauge condensation investigated here is the correlator of the spatial Polyakov loop. We also consider, for the first time, the correlator of the gauge invariant scalar field, associated to the exponent of the Polyakov loop. Using real-time lattice simulations of classical-statistical $SU(2)$ gauge theory, we find gauge condensation on a system-size dependent time scale $t_{\\text{cond}} \\sim L^{1/Œ∂}$ with a universal scaling exponent $Œ∂$. Furthermore, we suggest an effective theory formulation describing the dynamics using one of the order parameters identified.

       "        We incorporate the empirical low-density properties of isospin symmetric nuclear matter into the excluded-volume model for quarkyonic matter by including attractive mean field in the nucleonic sector and considering variations on the nucleon excluded volume mechanism. This corresponds to the quantum van der Waals equation for nucleons, with the interaction parameters fixed to empirical ground state properties of nuclear matter. The resulting equation of state exhibits the nuclear liquid-gas transition at $n_B \\leq œÅ_0$ and undergoes a transition to quarkyonic matter at densities $n_B \\sim 1.5-2 œÅ_0$ that are reachable in intermediate energy <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">ion</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span>.

The strong magnetic field induces anisotropy, that is, the quantization of Landau energy levels in phase space. If the magnetic field is strong enough, it will interfere with significant QCD phenomena, such as the generation of dynamic quark mass, which may affect the transport properties of quark matter. The inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moments (AMM) of the quarks at finite density into the NJL model gives rise to additional spin polarization magnetic effects. As the inclusion of AMM of the quarks leads to inverse magnetic catalysis around the transition temperature, we will systematically study the thermodynamic phase transition characteristics of shear viscosity coefficient in QCD media near the phase boundary. The shear viscosity coefficient of the dissipative fluid system can be decomposed into five different components as the strong magnetic field exists. The influences of the order of chiral phase transition and the critical endpoint on dissipative phenomena in such a magnetized medium are quantitatively investigated. It is found that $Œ∑_{1}$, $Œ∑_{2}$, $Œ∑_{3}$, and $Œ∑_{4}$ all increase with temperature. For first-order phase transitions, $Œ∑_{1}$, $Œ∑_{2}$, $Œ∑_{3}$, and $Œ∑_{4}$ exhibit discontinuous characteristics.\n",

Almost all of them have a prediction that unitary is violated in these high energies so that probability of producing electron-positron pairs is greater than one. It is clear that at RHIC and LHC energies, probabilities of producing electron-positron pairs for impact parameters smaller than Compton-wavelength of electron is greater than one. This means that for small impact parameters where the electric field is strongest multiple electron-positron pair productions is inescapable and it must be included in calculations. In literature, there are number of explanations about the pperp broadening however none of them has included the multi-pair production processes in their calculations. The aim of this paper is to show that electron-positron multi-pair production cross section is large and it can not be ignored in calculations.\n",

The energy of the $Œ≥$-rays can be measured by collecting the ƒåerenkov light in medium induced by the fast electrons generated in Compton scattering or electromagnetic shower of the incident $Œ≥$ ray. Two types of detectors, based on pure water and lead glass as the sensitive material respectively, are designed for the above purpose. The $Œ≥$ response and optical photon propagation in detectors have been simulated based on the electromagnetic and optical processes in Geant4. The inherent energy resolution of $0.022+0.51/E_Œ≥^{1/2}$ for water and $0.002+0.45/E_Œ≥^{1/2}$ for lead glass are obtained. The geometry size of lead glass and water are optimized at $30\\times 30 \\times 30$ cm$^3$ and $60\\times 60 \\times 120$ cm$^3$, respectively, for detecting high energy $Œ≥$-rays at 160 MeV. Hough transform method has been applied to reconstruct the direction of the incident $Œ≥$-rays, giving the ability to distinguish experimentally the high-energy $Œ≥$ rays produced in the reactions on the target from the random background cosmic ray muons.\n",

There are two main possible models to explain their production mechanism - the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model suggests that the light nuclei are produced from a thermal source, where they are in equilibrium with other species present in the fireball. However, due to the small binding energies, the produced nuclei are not likely to survive the high-temperature conditions of the fireball. The coalescence model tries to explain the production of light nuclei by assuming that they are formed at later stages by the coalescence of protons and neutrons near the kinetic freeze-out surface. The final-state coalescence of nucleons will lead to the mass number scaling of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of light nuclei. This scaling states that the $v_2$ of light nuclei scaled by their respective mass numbers will follow very closely the $v_2$ of nucleons. Therefore, studying the $v_2$ of light nuclei and comparing it with the $v_2$ of protons will help us in understanding their production mechanism.\n",

       "        The effect of the temperature evolution of QGP on its thermal conductivity and elliptic flow is investigated here in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field.

The magnetic field produced during the early stages of (non-central) <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span>-<span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">ion</span> <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collisions</span> decays with time, where electrical conductivity plays a significant role. As the medium expands, the electrical and thermal properties change, reflecting the effect in various observables. In this study, we have calculated the thermal conductivity of the QGP medium, incorporating the effects of temperature and magnetic field evolution. We discovered that conductivity significantly depends on the cooling rate and its value increases due to temperature evolution. Furthermore, the influence of these evolutions on the elliptic flow coefficient is measured, and elliptic flow is found to decrease.\n",

Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">collision</span> events requires a precise understanding of the evolution of <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span> quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through the nearly thermal and strongly coupled plasma. Systematic theoretical studies of quarkonium time evolution in the QGP in the regime where the temperature of the QGP is much smaller than the inverse of quarkonium size have only been carried out in the past few years. Such calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields dressed with Wilson lines, which is similar to, but different from, the correlation used to define the well-known arXiv:hep-ph/0605199 <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span> quark diffusion coefficient. The origin of this difference has been explained in arXiv:2107.03945, arXiv:2205.04477, arXiv:2306.13127. Here we show the results of the calculation of the analogous correlator in strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM using the AdS/CFT correspondence at a finite temperature arXiv:2304.03298. While it resembles the open <span class=\"search-hit mathjax\">heavy</span> quark case, it has some crucial differences that highlight the relevance of quantum color correlations. We will also discuss the results for the quarkonium transport coefficients obtained from this correlator, thereby establishing the first analytic results at strong coupling in this context. We find that they vanish in the strong coupling limit for an $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma with a large number of colors.\n",

It is best studied by mapping $\\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$ to $dS_{3}\\times \\mathbf{R}$ when the field theory has conformal symmetry. We show that at late de Sitter time, which corresponds to large proper time and central region in $\\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, the generic behavior for a holographic conformal field theory is given by $\\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$, with $\\varepsilon$, $P_T$ and $P_L$ being the energy density, transverse and longitudinal pressures, respectively. We also establish the general late de Sitter time expansion, which when written in a suitable basis, systematically determines both the early proper time behavior and the behavior at large distance from the beam axis at any fixed proper time in the Minkowski frame. Particularly, $\\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$ is also generically realized at early proper time. The late de Sitter time expansion is also consistent with the hydrodynamic expansion at intermediate times.\n",

However, despite important developments in the last years, a description of the real-time evolution of QCD jets inside a medium is still far from complete. In our previous work, we have explored quantum technologies as a promising alternative theoretical laboratory to simulate jet evolution in QCD matter, to overcome inherent technical difficulties in present calculations. Here, we extend our previous investigation from the single particle to the multiple particle Fock spaces, taking into account gluon production. Based on the light-front Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multi-particle jet probe in the presence of a stochastic color background. Using the quantum simulation algorithm, we show the medium-induced modification to the jet evolution in both the momentum broadening and gluon production.\n",

      "[\"Utilizing a quark model characterized by parameters that effectively replicate the masses of ground state hadrons, we illustrate that $(us)$ or $(ds)$ diquarks exhibit greater compactness in comparison to $(ud)$ diquarks. Concretely, the binding energy of the $(us)$ diquark - defined as the diquark's mass minus the combined masses of its individual quarks - is found to be more attractive than that of the $(ud)$ diquark. This heightened attraction present in $(us)$ diquarks could lead to enhanced production of $Œû_c/D$ particles in high-energy pp or ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥\", 'We revisit the graphic table of QCD signatures in our 1996 Annual Reviews article \"The Search for the Quark-Gluon Plasma\" and assess the progress that has been made since its publication towards providing quantitative evidence for the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and its characteristic properties.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Within the Transport Model Evaluation Project (TMEP), we present a detailed study of Sn+Sn collisions at 270A MeV, which are representative reactions used to study the equation of state at suprasaturation densities. We put particular emphasis on the production of pions and $Œî$ resonances, which have been used as probes of the nuclear symmetry energy. In this study, we prescribe a common and rather simple physical model, and follow in detail the results of 4 Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) models and 6 quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) models. We find that the nucleonic evolution of the collision and the nucleonic observables in these codes do not completely converge, but that the differences among the codes can be understood as being due to several reasons: the basic differences between BUU and QMD models in the representation of the phase-space distributions, computational differences in the mean-field evaluation, and differences in the adopted strategies for the Pauli blocking in the collision integrals. For pionic observables, we find that a higher maximum density leads to an enhanced pion yield and a reduced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, while a more effective Pauli blocking generally leads to a slightly suppressed pion yield and an enhanced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, although differences in its implementations do not have a dominating role in the differences among the codes. We specifically investigate the effect of the Coulomb force, and find that it increases the total $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio but reduces the ratio at high pion energies. Using only the results of codes that strictly follow the homework specifications, we find a convergence of the codes in the final charged pion yield ratio to less than $15\\\\%$, while the uncertainty is expected to be reduced to about $4\\\\%$ if the same or similar ingredients are incorporated in each code.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'A new method is proposed by incorporating the cluster correlation into the dynamical evolution of the standard quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) model. We demonstrate for the first time, the potential of the transport model in the description of light cluster production including the deuteron, triton, $^{3}$He and $Œ±$ in fermi-energy heavy-ion collisions. Both the experimental multiplicities of light clusters and the charge distributions of heavier fragments are reasonably reproduced in the broad energy regime. The preequilibrium clusters via the multinucleon correlation dominate the yields in the fragmentation reactions, which are influenced by the multinucleon collisions, Mott effect, rescattering and rebounding between the nucleons and clusters. The enhancement of $Œ±$ production at the Fermi energies is caused by the larger binding energy and fermionic properties.\\n        ‚ñ≥', \"We highlight the STAR experiment's hard probes results, including jets and heavy flavor production in heavy-ion collisions to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Various jet-substructure observables in proton-proton collisions are presented to explore both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of quantum chromodynamics. Finally, we discuss the STAR experiment's hard probes physics program for ongoing data taking.\\n        ‚ñ≥\", \"Viscous hydrodynamics serves as a successful mesoscopic description of the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In order to investigate, how such an effective description emerges from the underlying microscopic dynamics we calculate the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes of linear response in the sound channel from a first-principle calculation in kinetic theory. We do this with a new approach wherein we discretize the collision kernel to directly calculate eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the evolution operator. This allows us to study the Green's functions at any point in the complex frequency space. Our study focuses on scalar theory with quartic interaction and we find that the analytic structure of Green's functions in the complex plane is far more complicated than just poles or cuts which is a first step towards an equivalent study in QCD kinetic theory.\\n        ‚ñ≥\", 'We compute the heavy quarkonium complex potential in an arbitrary magnetic field strength generated in the relativistic heavy-ion collision. First, the one-loop gluon polarization tensor is obtained in the presence of an external, constant, and homogeneous magnetic field using the Schwinger proper time formalism in Euclidean space. The gluon propagator is computed from the gluon polarization tensor, and it is used to calculate the dielectric permittivity in the presence of the magnetic field in the static limit. The modified dielectric permittivity is then used to compute the heavy quarkonium complex potential. We find that the heavy quarkonium complex potential is anisotropic in nature, which depends on the angle between the quark-antiquark ($Q\\\\bar{Q}$) dipole axis and the direction of the magnetic field. We discuss the effect of the magnetic field strength and the angular orientation of the dipole on the heavy quarkonium potential. We discuss how the magnetic field influences the thermal widths of quarkonium states. Further, we also discuss the limitation of the strong-field approximation as done in literature in the light of heavy-ion observables, as the effect of the magnetic field is very nominal to the quarkonium potential.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We perform a systematic study of dilepton emission in a hot QCD medium based on three different scenarios of chiral mixing, each of which yields a characteristic structure in the vector spectral function. The in-medium spectral functions are accommodated into the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations for a relativistic viscous fluid to calculate the dilepton production rate, fully accounting for the space-time evolution of a created fireball in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the low-temperature theorem of chiral mixing extrapolated toward a chiral crossover, often used in the literature, leads to critical shortcomings: the inadequacy of width broadening, and a substantial overestimate of the dilepton yield maximized around the invariant mass of $M = 1.2$ GeV. The proper prescription offers a milder yet sizable increase in the window of $1.1 < M < 1.4$ GeV as the direct signature of chiral symmetry restoration.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $Œ±= a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe, and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Significant excesses of $e^+e^-$ pair production at very low transverse momentum ($p_T <$ 0.15 GeV/c) were observed by the STAR collaboration in hadronic heavy-ion collisions. Such enhancement is assumed to be a sign of photon-photon production in heavy-ion collisions with hadronic overlap, based on comparisons with model calculations for spherical Au + Au collisions. However, there is a lack of calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair production from coherent photon-photon interactions in hadronic U + U collisions, due to the deformity of Uranium nuclei. In this article, we present calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair photoproduction at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV in both spherical and deformed U + U collisions within STAR detector acceptance using the equivalent photon approximation (EPA). We conduct event-by-event analysis to investigate the effects of initial nuclear deformation on pair production. Our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data for the 40%--60% and 60%--80% centrality classes in U + U collisions, and the differences between spherical and deformed configurations are approximately 3\\\\%. We also calculate the yields of the photoproduced $e^+e^-$ pair in hadronic deformed Ru + Ru and Zr + Zr collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The results reveal that the ratios of the yields of Ru to Zr exhibit very small differences ($<$ 1%) between spherical and deformed cases.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is created whose pre-equilibrium evolution includes a rich variety of exciting phenomena of Quantum Chromodynamics. In these Proceedings, we provide a short overview of our current understanding of the pre-equilibrium dynamics of the QGP from a weak-coupling perspective and highlight recent developments. Focusing on new studies, we then discuss how initial stages of the QGP medium may impact hard probes including direct photons, dileptons, jets, and heavy quarks. This introduces promising opportunities to obtain experimental signatures of the pre-equilibrium QGP.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'The article presents a study aimed at probing the dependence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) on the magnetic field strength using the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) model in Pb--Pb at LHC energies. The results demonstrate the quadratic dependence of the correlators used for the study of the CME in heavy ion collisions on the number of spectators, a proxy of the magnitude of the magnetic field. The article also presents the extension of this approach to a two dimensional space, formed by both the aforementioned proxy of the magnetic field strength but also a proxy of the final state ellipticity, a key ingredient of the background in these measurements, for each centrality interval. This provides an exciting possibility to experiments to isolate the background contributions from the potential CME signal.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'In-medium masses of the light vector $œâ$, $œÅ$ and axial-vector $A_1$ mesons are studied in the magnetized nuclear matter, accounting for the effects of (inverse) magnetic catalysis at finite temperature. The in-medium partial decay widths for the $A_1\\\\rightarrow œÅœÄ$ channels are studied from the in-medium masses of the initial and the final state particles, by applying a phenomenological Lagrangian to account for the $A_1œÅœÄ$ interaction vertices. The masses are calculated within the QCD sum rule framework, with the medium effects coming through the light quark ($\\\\sim \\\\langle \\\\bar{q}q \\\\rangle$) and the scalar gluon condensates ($\\\\sim \\\\langle G^2 \\\\rangle$), as well as the light four-quark condensate ($\\\\sim \\\\langle \\\\bar{q}q\\\\rangle^2 $). The condensates are calculated within the chiral $SU(3)$ model in terms of the medium modified scalar fields: isoscalar $œÉ$, $Œ∂$, isovector $Œ¥$ and the dilaton field $œá$. The effects of magnetic fields are incorporated through the magnetized Dirac sea contribution as well as the Landau energy levels of protons and anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) of the nucleons at finite temperature nuclear matter. The incorporation of the magnetic field through the Dirac sea of nucleons lead to an enhancement (reduction) of the light quark condensates with magnetic field, give rise to the phenomenon of magnetic (inverse) catalysis. The effects of (inverse) magnetic catalysis at finite temperature nuclear matter are studied on the spectral functions and production cross-sections of the neutral $œÅ$ and $A_1$ mesons. This may affect the production of the light vector and axial-vector mesons in the peripheral heavy-ion collision experiments, where estimated magnetic field is very large at the early stages of collisions with very high temperature.\\n        ‚ñ≥', \"We discuss possible future studies of photon-photon (light-by-light) scattering using a planned FoCal and ALICE 3 detectors. We include different mechanisms of $Œ≥Œ≥\\\\toŒ≥Œ≥$ scattering, such as double-hadronic photon fluctuations, $t/u$-channel neutral pion exchange or resonance excitations ($Œ≥Œ≥\\\\to R$) and deexcitation ($R \\\\to Œ≥Œ≥$). The broad range of (pseudo)rapidities and lower cuts on transverse momenta open a necessity to consider not only dominant box contributions but also other subleading contributions. Here we include low mass resonant $R = œÄ^0$, $Œ∑$, $Œ∑'$ contributions. The resonance contributions give intermediate photon transverse momenta. However, these contributions can be eliminated by imposing windows on di-photon invariant mass. We study and quantify individual box contributions (leptonic, quarkish). The electron/positron boxes dominate at low $M_{Œ≥Œ≥}<1$ GeV di-photon invariant masses. The PbPb$\\\\to$PbPb$Œ≥Œ≥$ cross section is calculated within equivalent photon approximation in the impact parameter space. Several differential distributions are presented and discussed. We consider four different kinematic regions. We predict cross section in the (mb-b) range for typical ALICE 3 cuts, a few orders of magnitude larger than for the current ATLAS or CMS experiments. We also consider the two-$œÄ^0$ background which can, in principle, be eliminated at the new kinematical range for the ALICE 3 measurements by imposing dedicated cuts on di-photon transverse momentum and\\\\or so-called vector asymmetry.\\n        ‚ñ≥\", 'We study the production cross-sections and radiative decay widths of heavy quarkonia (charmonia and bottomonia) in magnetized nuclear matter. The production cross-sections of the $œà(3770)$ and $Œ•(4S)$ are studied from the medium modifications of the masses and partial decay widths to open charm (bottom) mesons. The heavy flavour meson masses are computed within a chiral effective model, including the effects of the Dirac sea (DS) of nucleons. The mixing of the pseudoscalar (P) meson and the longitudinal component of the vector (V) meson (PV mixing) due to the presence of the magnetic field are considered in the present study. The radiative decay widths of the vector (V) heavy quarkonia to the pseudoscalar (P) mesons ($J/œà\\\\rightarrow Œ∑_c(1S) Œ≥$, $œà(2S)\\\\rightarrow Œ∑_c(2S) Œ≥$ and $œà(1D)\\\\rightarrow Œ∑_c(2S) Œ≥$ for the charm sector and $Œ•(NS)\\\\rightarrow Œ∑_b(NS)Œ≥$, $N$=1,2,3,4, for the bottom sector) in the magnetized asymmetric nuclear matter are also investigated in the present work. The difference in the mass of the transverse component from the longitudinal component of the vector meson, arising due to PV mixing, is observed as a distinct double peak structure in the invariant mass spectrum of the production cross-section of $œà(3770)$. The modifications of the production cross-sections as well as the radiative decay widths of the heavy quarkonia in the magnetized matter should have observable consequences on the production of these heavy flavour mesons resulting from ultra-relativistic peripheral heavy ion collision experiments, where the created magnetic field can be extremely large.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'The high-intensity beams provided by the CERN SPS in a large range of energies offer a unique opportunity to investigate the region of the QCD phase diagram at high baryochemical potential. The NA60+ experiment, proposed for taking data with heavy-ion collisions at the SPS in the next years, is in an ideal position to provide new insights into the QCD phase diagram, measuring rare probes via a Pb-Pb and p-A beam-energy scan, in the collisions energy interval $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 6-17 GeV. NA60+ plans to measure the production of hidden and open charm hadrons and prospects on these measurements will be discussed. Open charm hadrons will be measured from their decays into charged hadrons, reconstructed from the tracks in the silicon detectors of the vertex telescope. This will enable high-precision measurements of the yield of D$^{0}$, D$^{+}$, and D$^{+}_{s}$ mesons, and of $Œõ_{c}^{+}$ baryons, thus allowing us to constrain the transport properties of the QGP and the charm-quark hadronisation. Charmonium states, J/$œà$ and $œà$(2S), will be measured through dimuon decays reconstructed with the muon spectrometer. Hence, by measuring the charmonium yield in p-A and Pb-Pb collisions at different collision energies, NA60+ will have a unique opportunity to study the threshold energy for the onset of deconfinement.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We study the energy deposition of a high-momentum parton traveling through a Quark-Gluon Plasma using QCD kinetic theory. We show that the energy is first transported to the soft sector by collinear cascade and then isotropised by elastic scatterings. Remarkably, we find that the jet wake can be well described by a thermal distribution function with angle-dependent temperature. This could be used for effective phenomenological descriptions of jet thermalization in realistic heavy-ion collision simulations.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'A brief overview of the theory of open heavy flavor dynamics in QCD matter produced in high energy heavy-ion collisions is presented. First, we will summarise the phenomenological efforts to estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficients obtained within different models. Then, the recent theoretical developments from different groups to probe the medium properties using heavy quarks will be presented. Heavy quarks are also considered as an ideal probe for the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions. In the end, we present the recent theoretical progress made to probe the early-stage effects, pre-equilibrium phase, and electromagnetic fields.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We perform two-pion Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry for the partially coherent pion-emitting sources in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. A longitudinal coherent emission length as well as a transverse coherent emission length are introduced to the pion generation coordinates in calculating the HBT correlation functions of the partially coherent sources. We compare the model results with and without the coherent emission conditions with the experimental data in Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energy $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV and in Pb+Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV, respectively. We find that the results of HBT radii and chaoticity parameter of the partially coherent sources are more closed to experimental data.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Studies related to $\\\\rm{J}/œà$ meson, a bound state of charm and anti-charm quarks ($c\\\\bar{c}$), in heavy-ion collisions, provide genuine testing grounds for the theory of strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). To better understand the underlying production mechanism, cold nuclear matter effects, and influence from the quark-gluon plasma, baseline measurements are also performed in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($p$--A) collisions. The inclusive $\\\\rm{J}/œà$ measurement has contributions from both prompt and non-prompt productions. The prompt $\\\\rm{J}/œà$ is produced directly from the hadronic interactions or via feed-down from directly produced higher charmonium states, whereas non-prompt $\\\\rm{J}/œà$ comes from the decay of beauty hadrons. In experiments, $\\\\rm{J}/œà$ is reconstructed through its electromagnetic decays to lepton pairs, in either $e^{+}+e^{-}$ or $Œº^{+}+Œº^{-}$ decay channels. In this work, for the first time, machine learning techniques are implemented to separate the prompt and non-prompt dimuon pairs from the background to obtain a better identification of the $\\\\rm{J}/œà$ signal for different production modes. The study has been performed in $pp$ collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s} = 7$ and 13 TeV simulated using PYTHIA8. Machine learning models such as XGBoost and LightGBM are explored. The models could achieve up to 99\\\\% prediction accuracy. The transverse momentum ($p_{\\\\rm T}$) and rapidity ($y$) differential measurements of inclusive, prompt, and non-prompt $\\\\rm{J}/œà$, its multiplicity dependence, and the $p_{\\\\rm T}$ dependence of fraction of non-prompt $\\\\rm{J}/œà$ ($f_{\\\\rm B}$) are shown. These results are compared to experimental findings wherever possible.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'In the present work we investigate the source of azimuthal asymmetry for nuclear collision using a model that contemplates particles produced in the initial hard collisions and the collective effects described by a Blast-Wave like expansion. The latter is described by the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann transport equation. The parameters regarding collective flow and asymmetry are fitted by the experimental data from $p_T$ spectrum and $v_2$ for PbPb and XeXe collisions at different centrality classes. As a by-product the ratio of final elliptic flow with the initial anisotropy, $v_2/Œµ_2$, and the average transverse momentum are predicted.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'There has been significant interest in recent years in studying the spin polarization of hyperons in heavy-ion collisions. However, describing the dynamic spin polarization of quarks in quark-gluon plasma fireballs in detail presents a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a phenomenological investigation of the dynamical spin polarization of quarks induced by the magnetic field at the pre-thermal stage in heavy-ion collisions using the recently developed theoretical tool of chiral kinetic theory. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic process of quark spin polarization induced by magnetic fields. Our findings demonstrate that the spin polarization of quarks is highly sensitive to the interactions between quarks. These interactions can delay the decay of the early spin polarization vector while accelerating the decay of the later spin polarization vector. Specifically, our simulations model the detailed process of how magnetic fields polarize quarks within the fireball by the average spin vector and reveal that quark interactions lead to an acceleration effect on the average spin, causing it to rapidly increase from zero before being rapidly destroyed. Notably, the induced magnetic field in the fireball has an incomplete electromagnetic response effect, and its increase in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field decaying has a delay effect.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Correlations of two or more particles have been an essential tool for understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of the quark-gluon plasma created in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. In this paper, we extend that framework to introduce a mathematical construction of multi-particle correlators that utilize correlations between arbitrary numbers of particles of interest (e.g. particles selected for their strangeness, heavy flavor, and conserved charges) and inclusive reference particles to estimate the azimuthal anisotropies of rare probes. To estimate the fluctuations and correlations in the azimuthal anisotropies of these particle of interest, we use these correlators in a system of cumulants, raw moments, and central moments. We finally introduce two classes of observables that can compare the fluctuations in the azimuthal anisotropies of particles of interest with reference particles at each order.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Recent results in high-multiplicity pp collisions show features similar to those that are associated with the formation of a quark$-$gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions. Investigating the modification of the intra-jet properties as a function of event multiplicity in pp collisions can provide deeper insight into the nature of these effects. We will present the recent measurements of multiplicity dependence of charged-particle jet properties (average charged particle multiplicity and fragmentation functions) for leading charged-particle jets. Jets are reconstructed using anti-$k_{\\\\rm T}$ jet finding algorithm with radius parameter $R$ = 0.4 in the jet $p_{\\\\rm T}$ range from 5$-$110 GeV/$c$ at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with ALICE.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We compute double-logarithmically enhanced corrections to $\\\\widehat{q}$ at relative order $O(g^2)$ in the setting of a weakly coupled quark-gluon plasma, observing how the thermal scale affects the region of phase space, which gives rise to these corrections. We furthermore clarify how the region of phase from which these corrections are borne is situated with respect to that from which the classical corrections arise at relative order $O(g)$. This represents a significant step towards our eventual goal of understanding which class of corrections dominate, thereby pushing forward our quantitative grasp on the phenomenon of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Heavy and light quarks produced in high-$p_T$ partonic collisions radiate differently. Heavy quarks regenerate their color field, stripped-off in the hard reaction, much faster than the light ones and radiate a significantly smaller fraction of the initial quark energy. This peculiar feature of heavy-quark jets leads to a specific shape of the fragmentation functions observed in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Differently from light flavors, the heavy quark fragmentation function strongly peaks at large fractional momentum $z$, i.e. the produced heavy-light mesons, $B$ or $D$, carry the main fraction of the jet momentum. This is a clear evidence of the dead-cone effect, and of a short production time of a heavy-light mesons. Contrary to propagation of a small $q\\\\bar q$ dipole, which survives in the medium due to color transparency, a heavy-light $Q\\\\bar q$ dipole promptly expands to a large size. Such a big dipole has no chance to remain intact in a dense medium produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. On the other hand, a breakup of such a dipole does not affect much the production rate of $Q\\\\bar q$ mesons, differently from the case of light $q\\\\bar q$ meson production.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'An overview of the phenomenology and experimental results on open heavy-flavour and quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC and at the LHC energies is presented, with special emphasis on observables that carry information from the different collision stages. Perspective for future measurements and phenomenological modeling, that will shed light on the current open question in heavy-ion collisions, will be also discussed.\\n        ‚ñ≥', \"Heavy quarks created in heavy-ion collisions serve as an excellent probe of the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The radiation pattern of jets formed from heavy quarks as they traverse the QGP exhibits a particularly interesting structure due to the interplay of two competing effects: the suppression of small-angle radiation, also known as the ``dead-cone'' effect, and the enhancement of emitted gluons by medium-induced radiation. In this Letter, we propose a new observable, based on the energy correlator approach to jet substructure, which will allow us to disentangle the two scales associated to these two phenomena and to determine under which conditions the dead-cone is filled by medium-induced radiation. Combined with the forthcoming high-statistics measurements of heavy-flavor jets, this work provides a novel tool to unravel the dynamics of the QGP.\\n        ‚ñ≥\", 'The search for the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions has been impeded by the significant background arising from the anisotropic particle emission pattern, particularly elliptic flow. To alleviate this background, the event shape selection (ESS) technique categorizes collision events according to their shapes and projects the CME observables to a class of events with minimal flow. In this study, we explore two event shape variables to classify events and two elliptic flow variables to regulate the background. Each type of variable can be calculated from either conventional single particles or innovatively particle pairs, resulting in four combinations of event shape and elliptic flow variables. By employing a toy model and the realistic event generator, event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (EBE-AVFD), we discover that the elliptic flow of resonances exhibits correlations with both the background and the potential CME signal, making it unsuitable for background control. Through the EBE-AVFD simulations of Au+Au collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV with various input scenarios, we ascertain that the optimal ESS strategy for background control entails utilizing the single-particle elliptic flow in conjunction with the event shape variable based on particle pairs.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We study the elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states, or $J/œà$, $œà(2S)$, and $œá_c(1P)$ mesons in heavy ion collisions. Starting from the evaluation of charmonia transverse momentum distributions and yields, we calculate elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states based on the coalescence model. We show that the internal structure, or the wave function distribution of charmonium states plays a significant role, especially when charmonium states are produced by charm quark recombination, leading to the transverse momentum distribution of the $œà(2S)$ meson as half large as that of the $J/œà$ meson. We also consider the dependence of the elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states on internal structures of charmonium states, and find that the wave function effects as well as feed-down contributions are averaged out for elliptic and triangular flow, resulting in similar elliptic and triangular flow for all charmonium states. We investigate further the elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states at low transverse momentum region, and also discuss the quark number scaling of elliptic and triangular flow for charmonium states.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We have used the relativistic second-order causal viscous hydrodynamics equipped with an equation of state which includes the QCD critical point to study the propagation of linear and nonlinear perturbations in quark gluon plasma created in a relativistic heavy-ion collision. We have also studied the behaviour of dynamic structure factor, which is calculated by taking the correlation of dynamical density fluctuation. It is found that the critical point has significant effects on the propagation of linear as well as on nonlinear perturbations. It is also found that the dynamic structure factors are substantially modified with the presence of the QCD critical point.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that at sufficiently high temperature ($T$) and/or baryon chemical potential ($Œº_B$), the state of matter is in the form of quarks and gluons, which are no longer confined within hadrons. This deconfined state of matter is known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The goal of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments is to create such a hot and dense state of matter and study its properties. Measurements of identified particle spectra in Au+Au collisions provide information on the bulk properties, such as integrated yield ($dN/dy$), average transverse momenta ($\\\\langle p_T \\\\rangle$), particle ratios, and freeze-out parameters of the medium produced. The systematic study of bulk properties sheds light on the particle production mechanism in these collisions. Also, the centrality dependence of the freeze-out parameters provides an opportunity to explore the QCD phase diagram.\\n  In this talk, we will present the transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons ($œÄ^{\\\\pm}$, $K^{\\\\pm}$, $p$, and $\\\\bar{p}$) at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.1$) in Au+Au collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\mathrm{NN}}} = 54.4$ GeV. The centrality dependence of $dN/dy$, particle ratios, and kinetic freeze-out parameters will also be presented, and their physics implications will be discussed. In addition, we will compare our results with previously published results at other collision energies.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'A fluid-dynamic approach to charm-quark diffusion in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is developed for the first time. Results for integrated yields and momentum distributions of charmed hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic description for the dynamics of the QGP coupled to an additional heavy-quark-antiquark current are shown. In addition to the thermodynamic Equation of State (EoS), this description uses a heavy-quark diffusion constant which we take from Lattice QCD calculations. The results describe quantitatively experimental data measured at the LHC at the center-of-mass energy of $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV up to $p_{\\\\rm T}\\\\sim$ 4-5 GeV/$c$, showing that charm quarks undergo a very fast hydrodynamization in the medium created by ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Local multiplicity fluctuations are an useful tool to understand the dynamics of the particle production and the phase-space changes from quarks to hadrons in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The study of scaling behavior of multiplicity fluctuations in geometrical configurations in multiparticle production can be performed using the factorial moments and recognized in terms of a phenomenon referred to as intermittency. In this contribution, the analysis of the factorial moment is presented for the multiplicity distributions of charged particles produced in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV, recorded with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The normalized factorial moments (NFM), $F_{q}$ of the spatial configurations of charged particles in two-dimensional angular ($Œ∑,\\\\varphi$) phase space are calculated. For a system with dynamic fluctuations due to the characteristic critical behavior near the phase transition, $F_{q}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing bin number or decreasing bin size which indicates self-similar fluctuations. Relating the $q^{\\\\rm{th}}$ order NFM ($F_{q}$) to the second-order NFM ($F_{2}$), the value of the scaling exponent ($ŒΩ$) is extracted, which indicates the order of the phase transition within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory. The dependence of scaling exponent on the $p_{\\\\rm{T}}$ bin width will be presented. The measurements are also compared with the corresponding results from the AMPT model and a Toy Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Angular distributions of charged particles relative to jet axes are studied in $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions as a function of the jet orientation with respect to the event plane.This differential study tests the expected path-length dependence of energy loss experienced by a hard-scattered parton as it traverses the hot and dense medium formed in heavy-ion collisions.A second-order event plane is used in the analysis as an experimental estimate of the reaction plane formed by the collision impact parameter and the beam direction. Charged-particle jets with $15 < p_{\\\\rm T, jet} <$ 20 and $20 < p_{\\\\rm T, jet} <$ 40 GeV/$c$ were reconstructed with the anti-$\\\\it{k}_{\\\\rm T}$ algorithm with radius parameter setting of \\\\(R=0.4\\\\) in the 20-50\\\\% centrality bin to maximize the initial-state eccentricity of the interaction region. The reaction plane fit method is implemented to remove the flow-modulated background with better precision than prior methods. Yields and widths of jet-associated charged-hadron distributions are extracted in three angular bins between the jet axis and the event plane. The event-plane (EP) dependence is further quantified by ratios of the associated yields in different EP bins. No dependence on orientation of the jet axis with respect to the event plane is seen within the uncertainties in the kinematic regime studied. This finding is consistent with a similar experimental observation by ALICE in $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collision data.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Nuclear collisions at sufficiently high energies are expected to produce far-from-equilibrium matter with a high density of gluons at early times. We show gauge condensation, which occurs as a consequence of the large density of gluons. To identify this condensation phenomenon, we construct two local gauge-invariant observables that carry the macroscopic zero mode of the gauge condensate. The first order parameter for gauge condensation investigated here is the correlator of the spatial Polyakov loop. We also consider, for the first time, the correlator of the gauge invariant scalar field, associated to the exponent of the Polyakov loop. Using real-time lattice simulations of classical-statistical $SU(2)$ gauge theory, we find gauge condensation on a system-size dependent time scale $t_{\\\\text{cond}} \\\\sim L^{1/Œ∂}$ with a universal scaling exponent $Œ∂$. Furthermore, we suggest an effective theory formulation describing the dynamics using one of the order parameters identified. The formation of a condensate at early times may have intriguing implications for the early stages in heavy ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We incorporate the empirical low-density properties of isospin symmetric nuclear matter into the excluded-volume model for quarkyonic matter by including attractive mean field in the nucleonic sector and considering variations on the nucleon excluded volume mechanism. This corresponds to the quantum van der Waals equation for nucleons, with the interaction parameters fixed to empirical ground state properties of nuclear matter. The resulting equation of state exhibits the nuclear liquid-gas transition at $n_B \\\\leq œÅ_0$ and undergoes a transition to quarkyonic matter at densities $n_B \\\\sim 1.5-2 œÅ_0$ that are reachable in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions. The transition is accompanied by a peak in the sound velocity. The results depend only mildly on the chosen excluded volume mechanism but do require the introduction of an infrared regulator $Œõ$ to avoid the acausal sound velocity. We also consider the recently proposed baryquark matter scenario for the realization of the Pauli exclusion principle, which yields a similar equation of state and turns out to be energetically favored in all the considered setups.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'We study the properties of the shear viscosity coefficient of quark matter near the chiral phase transition at finite temperature and chemical potential, and the kinds of high temperature, high density and strong magnetic field background might be generated by high-energy heavy ion collisions. The strong magnetic field induces anisotropy, that is, the quantization of Landau energy levels in phase space. If the magnetic field is strong enough, it will interfere with significant QCD phenomena, such as the generation of dynamic quark mass, which may affect the transport properties of quark matter. The inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moments (AMM) of the quarks at finite density into the NJL model gives rise to additional spin polarization magnetic effects. As the inclusion of AMM of the quarks leads to inverse magnetic catalysis around the transition temperature, we will systematically study the thermodynamic phase transition characteristics of shear viscosity coefficient in QCD media near the phase boundary. The shear viscosity coefficient of the dissipative fluid system can be decomposed into five different components as the strong magnetic field exists. The influences of the order of chiral phase transition and the critical endpoint on dissipative phenomena in such a magnetized medium are quantitatively investigated. It is found that $Œ∑_{1}$, $Œ∑_{2}$, $Œ∑_{3}$, and $Œ∑_{4}$ all increase with temperature. For first-order phase transitions, $Œ∑_{1}$, $Œ∑_{2}$, $Œ∑_{3}$, and $Œ∑_{4}$ exhibit discontinuous characteristics.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'The STAR collaboration has observed an excess production of electron-positron pairs which have transverse momenta pperp < 150 MeV/c in peripheral gold-gold and uranium-uranium collisions. \\nALICE has also reported on an excess of mu mu pairs at low pperp in very peripheral lead-lead collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV/nucleon pair. In literature, there are number of studies about the electromagnetic lepton pair productions in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Almost all of them have a prediction that unitary is violated in these high energies so that probability of producing electron-positron pairs is greater than one. It is clear that at RHIC and LHC energies, probabilities of producing electron-positron pairs for impact parameters smaller than Compton-wavelength of electron is greater than one. This means that for small impact parameters where the electric field is strongest multiple electron-positron pair productions is inescapable and it must be included in calculations. In literature, there are number of explanations about the pperp broadening however none of them has included the multi-pair production processes in their calculations. The aim of this paper is to show that electron-positron multi-pair production cross section is large and it can not be ignored in calculations.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'The energetic bremsstrahlung photons up to 100 MeV produced in heavy ion collisions can be used as a sensitive probe to the short range correlation in atomic nuclei. The energy of the $Œ≥$-rays can be measured by collecting the ƒåerenkov light in medium induced by the fast electrons generated in Compton scattering or electromagnetic shower of the incident $Œ≥$ ray. Two types of detectors, based on pure water and lead glass as the sensitive material respectively, are designed for the above purpose. The $Œ≥$ response and optical photon propagation in detectors have been simulated based on the electromagnetic and optical processes in Geant4. The inherent energy resolution of $0.022+0.51/E_Œ≥^{1/2}$ for water and $0.002+0.45/E_Œ≥^{1/2}$ for lead glass are obtained. The geometry size of lead glass and water are optimized at $30\\\\times 30 \\\\times 30$ cm$^3$ and $60\\\\times 60 \\\\times 120$ cm$^3$, respectively, for detecting high energy $Œ≥$-rays at 160 MeV. Hough transform method has been applied to reconstruct the direction of the incident $Œ≥$-rays, giving the ability to distinguish experimentally the high-energy $Œ≥$ rays produced in the reactions on the target from the random background cosmic ray muons.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Loosely bound light nuclei are produced in abundance in heavy-ion collisions. There are two main possible models to explain their production mechanism - the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model suggests that the light nuclei are produced from a thermal source, where they are in equilibrium with other species present in the fireball. However, due to the small binding energies, the produced nuclei are not likely to survive the high-temperature conditions of the fireball. The coalescence model tries to explain the production of light nuclei by assuming that they are formed at later stages by the coalescence of protons and neutrons near the kinetic freeze-out surface. The final-state coalescence of nucleons will lead to the mass number scaling of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of light nuclei. This scaling states that the $v_2$ of light nuclei scaled by their respective mass numbers will follow very closely the $v_2$ of nucleons. Therefore, studying the $v_2$ of light nuclei and comparing it with the $v_2$ of protons will help us in understanding their production mechanism.\\n  In this talk, we will present the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and centrality dependence of $v_2$ of $d$, $t$, and $^3\\\\text{He}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6, 27, and 54.4 GeV. Mass number scaling of $v_2(p_T)$ of light (anti-)nuclei will be shown and physics implications will be discussed.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Two critical end points (CEPs) of the chiral phase transition and the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition show up at finite baryon chemical potential. The kurtosis $Œ∫œÉ^2$ of baryon number fluctuation on the $T-Œº_B$ plane is positive on the first-order side and negative on the crossover side along the phase boundary. The freeze-out line extracted from the heavy ion collisions crosses between these two phase boundaries, one can observe a peak of $Œ∫œÉ^2$ around the collision energy $5 {\\\\rm GeV}$ near the CEP of the chiral phase transition, and negative $Œ∫œÉ^2$ at low collision energies due to the CEP of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. This expalains the experimental measurement of $Œ∫œÉ^2$ at the collision energies of 2.4 GeV at HADES and 3 GeV and 7.7-200 GeV at STAR for most central collision. Thus we propose that the baryon number fluctuation $Œ∫œÉ^2$ can be used as a probe of nuclear matter phase structure at high baryon density.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'The effect of the temperature evolution of QGP on its thermal conductivity and elliptic flow is investigated here in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field. Thermal conductivity plays a vital role in the cooling rate of the medium or its temperature evolution. The magnetic field produced during the early stages of (non-central) heavy-ion collisions decays with time, where electrical conductivity plays a significant role. As the medium expands, the electrical and thermal properties change, reflecting the effect in various observables. In this study, we have calculated the thermal conductivity of the QGP medium, incorporating the effects of temperature and magnetic field evolution. We discovered that conductivity significantly depends on the cooling rate and its value increases due to temperature evolution. Furthermore, the influence of these evolutions on the elliptic flow coefficient is measured, and elliptic flow is found to decrease.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'The spin polarization of heavy quarks in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC is estimated from effective field theories (EFTs). One EFT is similar to the HQET used at zero temperature. This gives a coupling of the heavy quark spin to colour and electromagnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions. The second EFT describes the interaction of heavy quarks and hydrodynamic modes, and gives the coupling between the heavy quark spin and the local vorticity of the fireball. Using these, we find that the measurement of polarization of the heavy quark from small to moderate p_T at the LHC is predicted with a single free parameter proportional to the vorticity. As a result, the heavy quark polarization is the same whether it is derived from the spin alignment of heavy vector mesons or the polarization of heavy baryons. We also predict that the parameter does not differ much between charm and bottom quarks.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Suppression of open heavy flavors and quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions is among the most informative probes of the quark-gluon plasma. Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the collision events requires a precise understanding of the evolution of heavy quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through the nearly thermal and strongly coupled plasma. Systematic theoretical studies of quarkonium time evolution in the QGP in the regime where the temperature of the QGP is much smaller than the inverse of quarkonium size have only been carried out in the past few years. Such calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields dressed with Wilson lines, which is similar to, but different from, the correlation used to define the well-known arXiv:hep-ph/0605199 heavy quark diffusion coefficient. The origin of this difference has been explained in arXiv:2107.03945, arXiv:2205.04477, arXiv:2306.13127. Here we show the results of the calculation of the analogous correlator in strongly coupled $\\\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM using the AdS/CFT correspondence at a finite temperature arXiv:2304.03298. While it resembles the open heavy quark case, it has some crucial differences that highlight the relevance of quantum color correlations. We will also discuss the results for the quarkonium transport coefficients obtained from this correlator, thereby establishing the first analytic results at strong coupling in this context. We find that they vanish in the strong coupling limit for an $\\\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma with a large number of colors.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'The CERN SuperProtoSynchrotron (SPS) represents an ideal facility for fixed-target heavy-ion experiments exploring the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in the region $200\\\\leŒº_{\\\\rm B}\\\\le500$ MeV.

The NA61/SHINE experiment is currently active and plans to perform a first direct measurement of open charm production in Pb--Pb collisions at top SPS energy and possibly at lower energies. The project of a new experiment, NA60+, based on a muon spectrometer coupled to a vertex spectrometer is currently being developed, for the study of dimuon and heavy quark production, and a Letter of Intent was recently submitted. In this contribution the physics motivation for the studies of rare probes, the existing and planned experimental set-ups and their expected physics performance will be discussed.\\n        ‚ñ≥', \"Using the recently developed ``Maximum Entropy'' (or ``least biased'') distribution function to truncate the moment hierarchy arising from kinetic theory, we formulate a far-from-equilibrium macroscopic theory that provides the possibility of describing both free-streaming and hydrodynamic regimes of heavy-ion collisions within a single framework. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic theories that include viscous corrections to finite order, the present formulation incorporates contributions to all orders in shear and bulk inverse Reynolds numbers, allowing it to handle large dissipative fluxes. By considering flow profiles relevant for heavy-ion collisions (Bjorken and Gubser flows), we demonstrate that the present approach provides excellent agreement with underlying kinetic theory throughout the fluid's evolution and, especially, in far-off-equilibrium regimes where traditional hydrodynamics breaks down.\\n        ‚ñ≥\", 'Gubser flow is an axis-symmetric and boost-invariant evolution in a relativistic quantum field theory, providing a model for the evolution of matter produced in the wake of heavy-ion collisions.

We show that at late de Sitter time, which corresponds to large proper time and central region in $\\\\mathbf{R}^{3,1}$, the generic behavior for a holographic conformal field theory is given by $\\\\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$, with $\\\\varepsilon$, $P_T$ and $P_L$ being the energy density, transverse and longitudinal pressures, respectively. We also establish the general late de Sitter time expansion, which when written in a suitable basis, systematically determines both the early proper time behavior and the behavior at large distance from the beam axis at any fixed proper time in the Minkowski frame. Particularly, $\\\\varepsilon = P_T = - P_L$ is also generically realized at early proper time. The late de Sitter time expansion is also consistent with the hydrodynamic expansion at intermediate times.\\n        ‚ñ≥', 'Jets provide one of the primary probes of the quark-gluon plasma produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and the cold nuclear matter explored in deep inelastic scattering experiments. However, despite important developments in the last years, a description of the real-time evolution of QCD jets inside a medium is still far from complete. In our previous work, we have explored quantum technologies as a promising alternative theoretical laboratory to simulate jet evolution in QCD matter, to overcome inherent technical difficulties in present calculations. Here, we extend our previous investigation from the single particle to the multiple particle Fock spaces, taking into account gluon production. Based on the light-front Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multi-particle jet probe in the presence of a stochastic color background.

       "  'Resumen': 'Within the Transport Model Evaluation Project (TMEP), we present a detailed study of Sn+Sn collisions at 270A MeV, which are representative reactions used to study the equation of state at suprasaturation densities. We put particular emphasis on the production of pions and $Œî$ resonances, which have been used as probes of the nuclear symmetry energy. In this study, we prescribe a common and rather simple physical model, and follow in detail the results of 4 Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) models and 6 quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) models. We find that the nucleonic evolution of the collision and the nucleonic observables in these codes do not completely converge, but that the differences among the codes can be understood as being due to several reasons: the basic differences between BUU and QMD models in the representation of the phase-space distributions, computational differences in the mean-field evaluation, and differences in the adopted strategies for the Pauli blocking in the collision integrals. For pionic observables, we find that a higher maximum density leads to an enhanced pion yield and a reduced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, while a more effective Pauli blocking generally leads to a slightly suppressed pion yield and an enhanced $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio, although differences in its implementations do not have a dominating role in the differences among the codes. We specifically investigate the effect of the Coulomb force, and find that it increases the total $œÄ^-/œÄ^+$ yield ratio but reduces the ratio at high pion energies. Using only the results of codes that strictly follow the homework specifications, we find a convergence of the codes in the final charged pion yield ratio to less than $15\\\\%$, while the uncertainty is expected to be reduced to about $4\\\\%$ if the same or similar ingredients are incorporated in each code.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

We demonstrate for the first time, the potential of the transport model in the description of light cluster production including the deuteron, triton, $^{3}$He and $Œ±$ in fermi-energy heavy-ion collisions. Both the experimental multiplicities of light clusters and the charge distributions of heavier fragments are reasonably reproduced in the broad energy regime. The preequilibrium clusters via the multinucleon correlation dominate the yields in the fragmentation reactions, which are influenced by the multinucleon collisions, Mott effect, rescattering and rebounding between the nucleons and clusters. The enhancement of $Œ±$ production at the Fermi energies is caused by the larger binding energy and fermionic properties.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

In order to investigate, how such an effective description emerges from the underlying microscopic dynamics we calculate the hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes of linear response in the sound channel from a first-principle calculation in kinetic theory. We do this with a new approach wherein we discretize the collision kernel to directly calculate eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the evolution operator. This allows us to study the Green's functions at any point in the complex frequency space. Our study focuses on scalar theory with quartic interaction and we find that the analytic structure of Green's functions in the complex plane is far more complicated than just poles or cuts which is a first step towards an equivalent study in QCD kinetic theory.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less\"},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'We compute the heavy quarkonium complex potential in an arbitrary magnetic field strength generated in the relativistic heavy-ion collision. First, the one-loop gluon polarization tensor is obtained in the presence of an external, constant, and homogeneous magnetic field using the Schwinger proper time formalism in Euclidean space. The gluon propagator is computed from the gluon polarization tensor, and it is used to calculate the dielectric permittivity in the presence of the magnetic field in the static limit. The modified dielectric permittivity is then used to compute the heavy quarkonium complex potential. We find that the heavy quarkonium complex potential is anisotropic in nature, which depends on the angle between the quark-antiquark ($Q\\\\bar{Q}$) dipole axis and the direction of the magnetic field. We discuss the effect of the magnetic field strength and the angular orientation of the dipole on the heavy quarkonium potential. We discuss how the magnetic field influences the thermal widths of quarkonium states. Further, we also discuss the limitation of the strong-field approximation as done in literature in the light of heavy-ion observables, as the effect of the magnetic field is very nominal to the quarkonium potential.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'We perform a systematic study of dilepton emission in a hot QCD medium based on three different scenarios of chiral mixing, each of which yields a characteristic structure in the vector spectral function. The in-medium spectral functions are accommodated into the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations for a relativistic viscous fluid to calculate the dilepton production rate, fully accounting for the space-time evolution of a created fireball in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the low-temperature theorem of chiral mixing extrapolated toward a chiral crossover, often used in the literature, leads to critical shortcomings: the inadequacy of width broadening, and a substantial overestimate of the dilepton yield maximized around the invariant mass of $M = 1.2$ GeV. The proper prescription offers a milder yet sizable increase in the window of $1.1 < M < 1.4$ GeV as the direct signature of chiral symmetry restoration.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $Œ±= a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate.

       "  'Resumen': 'Significant excesses of $e^+e^-$ pair production at very low transverse momentum ($p_T <$ 0.15 GeV/c) were observed by the STAR collaboration in hadronic heavy-ion collisions. Such enhancement is assumed to be a sign of photon-photon production in heavy-ion collisions with hadronic overlap, based on comparisons with model calculations for spherical Au + Au collisions. However, there is a lack of calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair production from coherent photon-photon interactions in hadronic U + U collisions, due to the deformity of Uranium nuclei. In this article, we present calculations for $e^+e^-$ pair photoproduction at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV in both spherical and deformed U + U collisions within STAR detector acceptance using the equivalent photon approximation (EPA). We conduct event-by-event analysis to investigate the effects of initial nuclear deformation on pair production. Our numerical results show good agreement with experimental data for the 40%--60% and 60%--80% centrality classes in U + U collisions, and the differences between spherical and deformed configurations are approximately 3\\\\%. We also calculate the yields of the photoproduced $e^+e^-$ pair in hadronic deformed Ru + Ru and Zr + Zr collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The results reveal that the ratios of the yields of Ru to Zr exhibit very small differences ($<$ 1%) between spherical and deformed cases.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The production cross-sections of the $œà(3770)$ and $Œ•(4S)$ are studied from the medium modifications of the masses and partial decay widths to open charm (bottom) mesons. The heavy flavour meson masses are computed within a chiral effective model, including the effects of the Dirac sea (DS) of nucleons. The mixing of the pseudoscalar (P) meson and the longitudinal component of the vector (V) meson (PV mixing) due to the presence of the magnetic field are considered in the present study.

The difference in the mass of the transverse component from the longitudinal component of the vector meson, arising due to PV mixing, is observed as a distinct double peak structure in the invariant mass spectrum of the production cross-section of $œà(3770)$. The modifications of the production cross-sections as well as the radiative decay widths of the heavy quarkonia in the magnetized matter should have observable consequences on the production of these heavy flavour mesons resulting from ultra-relativistic peripheral heavy ion collision experiments, where the created magnetic field can be extremely large.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'There has been significant interest in recent years in studying the spin polarization of hyperons in heavy-ion collisions. However, describing the dynamic spin polarization of quarks in quark-gluon plasma fireballs in detail presents a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a phenomenological investigation of the dynamical spin polarization of quarks induced by the magnetic field at the pre-thermal stage in heavy-ion collisions using the recently developed theoretical tool of chiral kinetic theory. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic process of quark spin polarization induced by magnetic fields. Our findings demonstrate that the spin polarization of quarks is highly sensitive to the interactions between quarks. These interactions can delay the decay of the early spin polarization vector while accelerating the decay of the later spin polarization vector. Specifically, our simulations model the detailed process of how magnetic fields polarize quarks within the fireball by the average spin vector and reveal that quark interactions lead to an acceleration effect on the average spin, causing it to rapidly increase from zero before being rapidly destroyed. Notably, the induced magnetic field in the fireball has an incomplete electromagnetic response effect, and its increase in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field decaying has a delay effect.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

Heavy quarks regenerate their color field, stripped-off in the hard reaction, much faster than the light ones and radiate a significantly smaller fraction of the initial quark energy. This peculiar feature of heavy-quark jets leads to a specific shape of the fragmentation functions observed in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Differently from light flavors, the heavy quark fragmentation function strongly peaks at large fractional momentum $z$, i.e. the produced heavy-light mesons, $B$ or $D$, carry the main fraction of the jet momentum. This is a clear evidence of the dead-cone effect, and of a short production time of a heavy-light mesons. Contrary to propagation of a small $q\\\\bar q$ dipole, which survives in the medium due to color transparency, a heavy-light $Q\\\\bar q$ dipole promptly expands to a large size. Such a big dipole has no chance to remain intact in a dense medium produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. On the other hand, a breakup of such a dipole does not affect much the production rate of $Q\\\\bar q$ mesons, differently from the case of light $q\\\\bar q$ meson production.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The radiation pattern of jets formed from heavy quarks as they traverse the QGP exhibits a particularly interesting structure due to the interplay of two competing effects: the suppression of small-angle radiation, also known as the ``dead-cone'' effect, and the enhancement of emitted gluons by medium-induced radiation. In this Letter, we propose a new observable, based on the energy correlator approach to jet substructure, which will allow us to disentangle the two scales associated to these two phenomena and to determine under which conditions the dead-cone is filled by medium-induced radiation.

       "  'Resumen': 'The search for the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions has been impeded by the significant background arising from the anisotropic particle emission pattern, particularly elliptic flow. To alleviate this background, the event shape selection (ESS) technique categorizes collision events according to their shapes and projects the CME observables to a class of events with minimal flow. In this study, we explore two event shape variables to classify events and two elliptic flow variables to regulate the background. Each type of variable can be calculated from either conventional single particles or innovatively particle pairs, resulting in four combinations of event shape and elliptic flow variables. By employing a toy model and the realistic event generator, event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (EBE-AVFD), we discover that the elliptic flow of resonances exhibits correlations with both the background and the potential CME signal, making it unsuitable for background control. Through the EBE-AVFD simulations of Au+Au collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV with various input scenarios, we ascertain that the optimal ESS strategy for background control entails utilizing the single-particle elliptic flow in conjunction with the event shape variable based on particle pairs.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

This deconfined state of matter is known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The goal of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments is to create such a hot and dense state of matter and study its properties. Measurements of identified particle spectra in Au+Au collisions provide information on the bulk properties, such as integrated yield ($dN/dy$), average transverse momenta ($\\\\langle p_T \\\\rangle$), particle ratios, and freeze-out parameters of the medium produced. The systematic study of bulk properties sheds light on the particle production mechanism in these collisions.

       "  'Resumen': 'Local multiplicity fluctuations are an useful tool to understand the dynamics of the particle production and the phase-space changes from quarks to hadrons in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The study of scaling behavior of multiplicity fluctuations in geometrical configurations in multiparticle production can be performed using the factorial moments and recognized in terms of a phenomenon referred to as intermittency. In this contribution, the analysis of the factorial moment is presented for the multiplicity distributions of charged particles produced in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV, recorded with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The normalized factorial moments (NFM), $F_{q}$ of the spatial configurations of charged particles in two-dimensional angular ($Œ∑,\\\\varphi$) phase space are calculated. For a system with dynamic fluctuations due to the characteristic critical behavior near the phase transition, $F_{q}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing bin number or decreasing bin size which indicates self-similar fluctuations. Relating the $q^{\\\\rm{th}}$ order NFM ($F_{q}$) to the second-order NFM ($F_{2}$), the value of the scaling exponent ($ŒΩ$) is extracted, which indicates the order of the phase transition within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory. The dependence of scaling exponent on the $p_{\\\\rm{T}}$ bin width will be presented. The measurements are also compared with the corresponding results from the AMPT model and a Toy Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The reaction plane fit method is implemented to remove the flow-modulated background with better precision than prior methods. Yields and widths of jet-associated charged-hadron distributions are extracted in three angular bins between the jet axis and the event plane. The event-plane (EP) dependence is further quantified by ratios of the associated yields in different EP bins. No dependence on orientation of the jet axis with respect to the event plane is seen within the uncertainties in the kinematic regime studied.

We show gauge condensation, which occurs as a consequence of the large density of gluons. To identify this condensation phenomenon, we construct two local gauge-invariant observables that carry the macroscopic zero mode of the gauge condensate. The first order parameter for gauge condensation investigated here is the correlator of the spatial Polyakov loop. We also consider, for the first time, the correlator of the gauge invariant scalar field, associated to the exponent of the Polyakov loop. Using real-time lattice simulations of classical-statistical $SU(2)$ gauge theory, we find gauge condensation on a system-size dependent time scale $t_{\\\\text{cond}} \\\\sim L^{1/Œ∂}$ with a universal scaling exponent $Œ∂$.

       "  'Resumen': 'We study the properties of the shear viscosity coefficient of quark matter near the chiral phase transition at finite temperature and chemical potential, and the kinds of high temperature, high density and strong magnetic field background might be generated by high-energy heavy ion collisions. The strong magnetic field induces anisotropy, that is, the quantization of Landau energy levels in phase space. If the magnetic field is strong enough, it will interfere with significant QCD phenomena, such as the generation of dynamic quark mass, which may affect the transport properties of quark matter. The inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moments (AMM) of the quarks at finite density into the NJL model gives rise to additional spin polarization magnetic effects. As the inclusion of AMM of the quarks leads to inverse magnetic catalysis around the transition temperature, we will systematically study the thermodynamic phase transition characteristics of shear viscosity coefficient in QCD media near the phase boundary. The shear viscosity coefficient of the dissipative fluid system can be decomposed into five different components as the strong magnetic field exists. The influences of the order of chiral phase transition and the critical endpoint on dissipative phenomena in such a magnetized medium are quantitatively investigated. It is found that $Œ∑_{1}$, $Œ∑_{2}$, $Œ∑_{3}$, and $Œ∑_{4}$ all increase with temperature.

In literature, there are number of studies about the electromagnetic lepton pair productions in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Almost all of them have a prediction that unitary is violated in these high energies so that probability of producing electron-positron pairs is greater than one. It is clear that at RHIC and LHC energies, probabilities of producing electron-positron pairs for impact parameters smaller than Compton-wavelength of electron is greater than one. This means that for small impact parameters where the electric field is strongest multiple electron-positron pair productions is inescapable and it must be included in calculations. In literature, there are number of explanations about the pperp broadening however none of them has included the multi-pair production processes in their calculations. The aim of this paper is to show that electron-positron multi-pair production cross section is large and it can not be ignored in calculations.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'Loosely bound light nuclei are produced in abundance in heavy-ion collisions. There are two main possible models to explain their production mechanism - the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model suggests that the light nuclei are produced from a thermal source, where they are in equilibrium with other species present in the fireball. However, due to the small binding energies, the produced nuclei are not likely to survive the high-temperature conditions of the fireball. The coalescence model tries to explain the production of light nuclei by assuming that they are formed at later stages by the coalescence of protons and neutrons near the kinetic freeze-out surface. The final-state coalescence of nucleons will lead to the mass number scaling of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of light nuclei. This scaling states that the $v_2$ of light nuclei scaled by their respective mass numbers will follow very closely the $v_2$ of nucleons. Therefore, studying the $v_2$ of light nuclei and comparing it with the $v_2$ of protons will help us in understanding their production mechanism.\\n  In this talk, we will present the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and centrality dependence of $v_2$ of $d$, $t$, and $^3\\\\text{He}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6, 27, and 54.4 GeV.

In this study, we have calculated the thermal conductivity of the QGP medium, incorporating the effects of temperature and magnetic field evolution.

One EFT is similar to the HQET used at zero temperature. This gives a coupling of the heavy quark spin to colour and electromagnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions. The second EFT describes the interaction of heavy quarks and hydrodynamic modes, and gives the coupling between the heavy quark spin and the local vorticity of the fireball. Using these, we find that the measurement of polarization of the heavy quark from small to moderate p_T at the LHC is predicted with a single free parameter proportional to the vorticity. As a result, the heavy quark polarization is the same whether it is derived from the spin alignment of heavy vector mesons or the polarization of heavy baryons.

Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the collision events requires a precise understanding of the evolution of heavy quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through the nearly thermal and strongly coupled plasma. Systematic theoretical studies of quarkonium time evolution in the QGP in the regime where the temperature of the QGP is much smaller than the inverse of quarkonium size have only been carried out in the past few years. Such calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields dressed with Wilson lines, which is similar to, but different from, the correlation used to define the well-known arXiv:hep-ph/0605199 heavy quark diffusion coefficient. The origin of this difference has been explained in arXiv:2107.03945, arXiv:2205.04477, arXiv:2306.13127.

       "  'Resumen': \"Using the recently developed ``Maximum Entropy'' (or ``least biased'') distribution function to truncate the moment hierarchy arising from kinetic theory, we formulate a far-from-equilibrium macroscopic theory that provides the possibility of describing both free-streaming and hydrodynamic regimes of heavy-ion collisions within a single framework. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic theories that include viscous corrections to finite order, the present formulation incorporates contributions to all orders in shear and bulk inverse Reynolds numbers, allowing it to handle large dissipative fluxes. By considering flow profiles relevant for heavy-ion collisions (Bjorken and Gubser flows), we demonstrate that the present approach provides excellent agreement with underlying kinetic theory throughout the fluid's evolution and, especially, in far-off-equilibrium regimes where traditional hydrodynamics breaks down.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less\"},\n",

However, despite important developments in the last years, a description of the real-time evolution of QCD jets inside a medium is still far from complete. In our previous work, we have explored quantum technologies as a promising alternative theoretical laboratory to simulate jet evolution in QCD matter, to overcome inherent technical difficulties in present calculations. Here, we extend our previous investigation from the single particle to the multiple particle Fock spaces, taking into account gluon production. Based on the light-front Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multi-particle jet probe in the presence of a stochastic color background. Using the quantum simulation algorithm, we show the medium-induced modification to the jet evolution in both the momentum broadening and gluon production.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

In this work, we analyse the effect of including such an exotic state on the yields of other light clusters, that not only form in astrophysical sites, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, but also in heavy-ion collisions. To this aim, we use a relativistic mean-field formalism, where we consider in-medium effects in a two-fold way, via the couplings of the clusters to the mesons, and via a binding energy shift, to compute the low-density equation of state for nuclear matter at finite temperature and fixed proton fraction. We consider five light clusters, deuterons, tritons, heliums, $Œ±$-particles, and $^6$He, immersed in a gas of protons and neutrons, and we calculate their abundances and chemical equilibrium constants with and without the tetraneutron. We also analyse how the associated energy of the tetraneutron would influence such results. We find that the low-temperature, neutron-rich systems, are the ones most affected by the presence of the tetraneutron, making neutron stars excellent environments for their formation. Moreover, its presence in strongly asymmetric matter may increase considerably the proton and the $Œ±$-particle fractions. This may have an influence on the dissolution of the accretion disk of the merger of two neutron stars.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

Because the longitudinal Lorentz contraction is small at these collision energies, understanding the dynamics during the early phase of the collision is essential for the subsequent modeling of the system evolution and for constraining the QGP transport properties at finite baryon densities. Direct photons provide undistorted information on early-stage dynamics. We model relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC Beam Energy Scan energies with a hybrid dynamical approach consisting of a 3D-Glauber initial state followed by viscous hydrodynamics and hadronic transport (MUSIC + UrQMD). The implemented thermal photon emission takes into account the enhancement from finite baryon chemical potentials. We show that direct photon spectra and their anisotropic flow coefficients have a strong sensitivity to the early stage of heavy-ion collisions. Thus, they provide constraints on QGP dynamics complementary to those obtained from hadronic observables.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

Our investigation entails measuring the second and third order factorization ratios ($r_{2}$ and $r_{3}$) across all these energies. We observed that the decorrelation is stronger at lower energies compared to higher collision energies, with this energy dependence trend being more prominent in $r_{3}$. Additionally, we analyze the contributions of flow-plane and flow magnitude decorrelation to the overall decorrelation phenomenon. Notably, our findings reveal that flow plane decorrelation exhibits a dominant contribution compared to flow magnitude decorrelation. Moreover, we incorporate a recently proposed observable, the four particle cumulant ($T_{2}$), which remains resilient to non-flow effects and exhibits sensitivity to different decorrelation patterns. Through the measurement of $T_{2}$, we consistently observe an S-shaped or torqued decorrelation across all energy ranges.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'We study the time evolution of the numbers of charm mesons after the kinetic freezeout of the expanding hadron gas produced by the hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma from a central heavy-ion collision. The $œÄD$ reaction rates have contributions from a $D^\\\\ast$ resonance in the $s$ channel. The $œÄD^\\\\ast$ reaction rates are enhanced by $t$-channel singularities from an intermediate $D$. The contributions to reaction rates from $D^\\\\ast$ resonances and $D$-meson $t$-channel singularities are sensitive to thermal mass shifts and thermal widths. In the expanding hadron gas, the $t$-channel singularities are regularized by the thermal $D$ widths. After kinetic freezeout, the thermal $D$ widths are dominated by coherent pion forward scattering. The contributions to $œÄD^\\\\ast$ reaction rates from $t$-channel singularities are inversely proportional to the pion number density, which decreases to 0 as the hadron gas expands. The $t$-channel singularities produce small but significant changes in charm-meson ratios from those predicted using the known $D^\\\\ast$-decay branching fractions.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'In this study, we investigated the influence of collision energy and system size on hadronic rescattering by analyzing the production of $K^{*0}$ mesons using the Ultra Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. Analysis are done in Au+Au collisions at various center-of-mass energies ($\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 200 GeV), as well as in Cu+Cu and isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at mid-rapidity. Our findings reveal that the ratio of $K^{*0}$ mesons to charged kaons ($K^{*0}/K$) decreases as the collision multiplicity increases. Moreover, at top RHIC energies, this ratio exhibits a smooth multiplicity scaling behavior. However, this scaling can be violated due to the formation of baryon-rich matter at lower beam energies, specifically $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 GeV or below. These results highlight the importance of considering the interplay between collision energy, system size, and the chemical composition of the produced matter when studying the hadronic rescattering effects in heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

First, using the semi-empirical mass formula with the DRHBc mass table, we investigate the symmetry energy at saturation density $œÅ_0$, denoted as $S_0$, and the ratio of surface to volume contributions to the symmetry energy, $Œ∫$. As a result, we obtain $S_0=27.85\\\\,{\\\\rm MeV}$ ($Œ∫=1.38$) for $a_{\\\\rm sym}(A) =S_0 (1 - Œ∫A^{-1/3})$ (Type I) and $S_0=32.66\\\\,{\\\\rm MeV}$ ($Œ∫=3.15$) for $a_{\\\\rm sym}(A) = S_0 (1 + Œ∫A^{-1/3} )^{-1}$ (Type II), which are lower than those obtained using the AME2020 mass table, $S_0=28.54\\\\,{\\\\rm MeV}$ ($Œ∫=1.29$) for Type I and $S_0=33.81\\\\,{\\\\rm MeV}$ ($Œ∫=3.04$) for Type II.

Holography is employed to tentatively map the QCD phase diagram at finite temperature onto a dual theory of charged, asymptotically AdS black holes in 5D. With a quantitative focus on the hot QCD phase diagram, the EMD models reviewed are adjusted to describe lattice results for the finite-temperature QCD equation of state, with 2+1 flavors and physical quark masses, at zero chemical potential and vanishing electromagnetic fields. The predictive power of EMD models is tested by quantitatively comparing their predictions for the hot QCD equation of state at nonzero baryon density and the corresponding state-of-the-art lattice QCD results. The shear and bulk viscosities predicted by these EMD models are also compared to the corresponding profiles favored by the latest phenomenological multistage models describing different heavy-ion data. We report preliminary results from a Bayesian analysis which provide systematic evidence that lattice results at finite temperature and zero baryon density strongly constrains the free parameters of EMD models. Remarkably, the set of parameters constrained by lattice results at zero chemical potential produces EMD models in quantitative agreement with lattice QCD results also at finite baryon density. We also review results for equilibrium and transport properties from anisotropic EMD models, describing the QGP at finite temperatures and magnetic fields. Finally, we provide a critical assessment of the main limitations and drawbacks of the holographic models reviewed in the present work, and point out some perspectives we believe are of fundamental importance for future developments.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'Mesons with heavy flavor content are an exceptional probe of the hot QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. In the past few years, significant progress has been made toward describing the modification of the properties of heavy mesons in the hadronic phase at finite temperature. Ground-state and excited-state thermal spectral properties can be computed within a self-consistent many-body approach that employs appropriate hadron-hadron effective interactions, providing a unique opportunity to confront hadronic Effective Field Theory predictions with recent and forthcoming lattice QCD simulations and experimental data. In this article, we revisit the application of the imaginary-time formalism to extend the calculation of unitarized scattering amplitudes from the vacuum to finite temperature. These methods allow us to obtain the ground-state thermal spectral functions. The thermal properties of the excited states that are dynamically generated within the molecular picture are also directly accessible. We present here the results of this approach for the open-charm and open-bottom sectors. We also analyze how the heavy-flavor transport properties, which are strongly correlated to experimental observables in heavy-ion collisions, are modified in hot matter. In particular, transport coefficients can be computed using an off-shell kinetic theory that is fully consistent with the effective theory describing the scattering processes. The results of this procedure for both charm and bottom transport coefficients are briefly discussed.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The properties of nuclear matter, quark matter, and quarkyonic matter are then investigated in a unified manner, where quarkyonic matter is more stable and energy minimization is still applicable to obtain the microscopic properties of dense matter. Three different covariant density functionals TW99, PKDD, and DD-ME2 are adopted in our work, where TW99 gives satisfactory predictions for the properties of nuclear matter both in neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions and quarkyonic transition is unfavorable. Nevertheless, if PKDD with larger slope of symmetry energy $L$ or DD-ME2 with larger skewness coefficient $J$ are adopted, the corresponding EOSs are too stiff according to both experimental and astrophysical constraints. The situation is improved if quarkyonic transition takes place, where the EOSs become softer and can accommodate various experimental and astrophysical constraints.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less\"},\n",

In particular, in neutron-rich systems such as ${}^{132}\\\\mathrm{Sn}+{}^{124}\\\\mathrm{Sn}$ collisions, we need to carefully treat the momentum dependence because the neutron and proton potentials can have different momentum dependence, as characterized at low momenta by effective masses.

The potentials affect not only the threshold condition for the process but also the cross section in general as a function of the momenta of the initial particles, which is treated in a natural way in the present work. Calculations are performed by combining the nucleon dynamics obtained by the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model with a newly developed transport code which we call sJAM.

       "  'Resumen': \"In traditional scattering theory, the incident projectile is assumed to have an infinite coherence length. However, over the last decade, experimental and theoretical studies of collisions using heavy ion projectiles have shown that this assumption is not always valid. This has led to a growing number of studies that specifically examined the effects of the projectile's coherence length on collision cross sections. These studies have used heavy ion projectiles because they offer a straight-forward method to control the projectile's coherence length through its momentum, and using these techniques, it has been demonstrated that the projectile's coherence length alters the cross sections. In contrast, it is widely presumed that the coherence length of an electron projectile is always sufficiently large that any effects on the cross sections can be safely neglected. We show that, contrary to this prevailing opinion, coherence effects are observable for electron projectiles and they can be controlled. We calculate triple differential cross sections (TDCSs) for ionization of H2+ using twisted electron projectiles in the form of Laguerre-Gauss and Bessel electrons. Effects of the projectile's coherence length are observed through the presence or absence of two-slit interference features in the TDCSs. When the electron projectile's coherence length is large, ionization occurs from either nuclear center of the molecule, and two-slit interference features are visible in the TDCSs. In contrast, when the projectile's coherence length is small, ionization occurs from only one nuclear center and the TDCSs resemble those for ionization of atomic hydrogen. We demonstrate that the intrinsic parameters of the vortex projectiles, such as beam waist and opening angle, can be used to control the coherence length of electron projectiles.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less\"},\n",

Recently, heavy-flavor femtoscopy has become feasible using the ALICE detector at the LHC. We compute the correlation function of $D$ mesons and light mesons using an off-shell $T$-matrix approach to access the two-meson wave function, and predict the correlation functions involving charged $D^+, D^{*+},D_s^+$ and $D_s^{*+}$ with $œÄ^\\\\pm$ and $K^\\\\pm$.

The presence of such poles imprints a depletion on the correlation function, which could potentially be detected in experiments. While preliminary ALICE data do not show evidence of this effect, we suggest to look into the $D_s^+ K^-$ system to explore the higher pole of the $D_0^* (2300)$, as the depletion in the correlation function is more pronounced. Using heavy-quark spin symmetry we also propose exploring the effect of the two poles of the $D_1(2430)$ and predict similar structures in the correlation functions of the $D^{*+} œÄ^-$ and $D_s^{*+} K^-$ pairs.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

However, despite important developments in the last years, a description of the real-time evolution of QCD jets inside a medium is still far from being complete. In our previous work, we have explored quantum technologies as a promising alternative theoretical laboratory to simulate jet evolution in QCD matter, to overcome inherent technical difficulties in present calculations. Here, we extend our previous investigation from the single particle $|q\\\\rangle$ to the $|q\\\\rangle+|qg\\\\rangle$ Fock space, taking into account gluon production. Based on the light-front Hamiltonian formalism, we construct a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multi-particle jet probe in the presence of a medium described as a stochastic color field. Studying the momentum broadening of the jet state, we observe sizable sub-eikonal effects by comparing to eikonal estimates. We also study the medium-induced modifications to the gluon emission probability, which exhibit small corrections compared to the vacuum splitting function. In addition, we study the time evolution of the von-Neumann entropy associated with the quark component; we find that the exponential of the entropy grows linearly in time for the bare quark but super-linearly when taking into account gluon emission.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'Extensive studies have been conducted in the past few decades to investigate potential signatures of higher-order QED effects in high-energy electromagnetic scattering processes. In our previous work, we have identified evidence of higher-order corrections in the total cross-section for the Breit-Wheeler process in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, the presence of higher-order QED corrections cannot be unambiguously proven solely based on total cross-section measurements due to substantial experimental and theoretical uncertainties. The objective of this paper is to explore the sensitivity of specific differential observables in the Breit-Wheeler process to higher-order QED effects in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. These investigations will provide guidance in determining the presence or absence of higher-order QED processes by conducting precise measurements in future experiments.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'In heavy-ion collisions, low relative-velocity two-particle correlations have been a tool for assessing space-time characteristics of particle emission. Those characteristics may be cast in the form of a relative emission source related to the correlation function through the Koonin-Pratt (KP) convolution formula that involves the relative wave-function for the particles in its kernel. In the literature, the source has been most commonly sought by parametrizing it in a Gaussian form and fitting to the correlation function. At times the source was more broadly imaged from the function, still employing a fitting. Here, we propose the use of the Richardson-Lucy (RL) optical deblurring algorithm for deducing the source from a correlation function. The RL algorithm originally follows from probabilistic Bayesian considerations and relies on the intensity distributions for the optical object and its image, as well as the convolution kernel, being positive definite, which is the case for the corresponding quantities of interest within the KP formula.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'In the standard model of particle physics, the strong force is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamic (QCD). Based on QCD properties, it is commonly believed that at sufficiently high temperatures or densities, the hadrons are melted into their constituent quarks, i.e., undergo a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons. Such phase is frequently called quark matter or quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Although QGP has been observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, it is currently an open question about the onset of deconfinement. By comparing simulations from a reliable hadron and quark relativistic transport model and recent STAR experimental data, we infer that the onset of hadron-quark phase transition occurs at about fivefold nuclear compression corresponding temperature $T\\\\sim$ 112 MeV and baryon chemical potential $Œº_{B}\\\\sim$ 586 MeV in nuclear matter phase diagram.

       "  'Resumen': 'A Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Monte Carlo model has been developed to describe jet propagation and interaction with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A complete set of elastic scattering processes and medium-induced gluon emissions based on the higher-twist formalism are incorporated for both jet shower and medium recoil partons. It has been employed to describe experimental data on large transverse momentum hadron and jet spectra, correlation and jet substructures in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We document in detail the structure of the model and validation of the Monte Carlo implementations of the physics processes in LBT, in particular, the inelastic process of medium-induced gluon radiation. We carry out a comprehensive examination of the jet-medium interaction as implemented in LBT through energy loss and momentum broadening of a single hard parton, the energy and transverse momentum transfer from leading partons to medium-induced gluons and jet-induced medium excitation, and medium modification of reconstructed jets in a static and uniform medium. With realistic and event-by-event hydrodynamic medium in heavy-ion collisions, we compute and compare to experimental data on the jet cone-size dependence of the single inclusive jet suppression at both Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the dijet asymmetry at LHC and $Œ≥$-jet correlation at RHIC. Effects of medium-induced gluon emissions and jet-induced medium excitation on jet observables are systematically examined. Rescatterings of the radiated gluons and recoil partons with the QGP are found essential to account for the enhancement of soft particle yield toward the edge of the jet cone.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

Studies of resilience of the nano antennas were published recently in vacuum and in UDMA-TEGDMA medium. These studies concluded that the lifetime of the plasmonic effect is longer in medium, however, less energy was observed in the UDMA-TEGDMA copolymer, due to the smaller resonant size of gold nanoantenna than in case of Vacuum. Here we show how the plasmonic effect behaves in an environment fully capable of ionization, surrounded by Hydrogen atoms close to liquid densities. We performed numerical simulations treating the electrons of gold in the conduction band as strongly coupled plasma. The results show that the protons close to the nanorod's surface follow the collectively moving electrons rather than the incoming electric field of the light. The results also show that the plasmonic accelerating effect is also dependent on the laser intensity.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less\"},\n",

Such an investigation is motivated by relativistic heavy-ion collisions, which create a blob of hot QCD matter of a finite volume, consisting of strongly interacting hadrons and potentially deconfined quarks and gluons. The effect of the finite volume of the system is incorporated by introducing a lower momentum cut-offs in the momentum integrals appearing in the model, the numerical value of the momentum cut-off being related to the de Broglie wavelength of the given particle species. It is found that some of these quantities show a significant volume dependence, in particular those sensitive to pion degrees of freedom, and the crossover transition is generally observed to become smoother in finite volume.

       "  'Resumen': 'Understanding the spin structure of the proton is of large interest to the nuclear physics community and it is one of the main goals of the spin physics program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Measurements from data taken by the PHENIX detector with transverse ($p^{\\\\uparrow} + p$, $p^{\\\\uparrow}$ + Al, $p^{\\\\uparrow}$ + Au) proton polarization play an important role in this, in particular, due to the leading order access to gluons in polarized protons. Transverse single-spin asymmetries (TSSAs) provide insight into initial and final state spin-momentum and spin-spin parton-hadron correlations. In addition to possible final state contributions, $œÄ^{0}$ and $Œ∑$ TSSAs access both quark and gluon correlations in the polarized proton. Furthermore, the $p^{\\\\uparrow} + A$ data from RHIC provides an opportunity to study the effect of TSSAs in the presence of additional nuclear matter. Midrapidity $œÄ^{0}$ and $Œ∑$ mesons are measured at PHENIX by detecting the 2$Œ≥$ decay with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) in the central arm spectrometer, which has fine granularity for the resolution of separate decay photons.

The complex dynamics of the collision before $\\\\approx 1$ fm/c is often described with parametric models, which affect the predictivity of calculations.

We obtain state-of-the-art constraints on the shear and bulk viscosity of quark-gluon plasma. We mitigate the additional cost of the ab-initio initial conditions by combining Bayesian model averaging with transfer learning, allowing us to account for important theoretical uncertainties in the hydrodynamics-to-hadron transition. We show that, despite the apparent strong constraints on the shear viscosity, metrics that balance the model's predictivity with its degree of agreement with data do not prefer a temperature-dependent specific shear viscosity over a constant value. We validate the model by comparing with discriminating observables not used in the calibration, finding excellent agreement.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less\"},\n",

In it, coherent photoproduction occurs when the target remains in the ground state, while, in incoherent photoproduction, the target breaks up. However, the GW paradigm fails to explain the observation of coherent vector meson photoproduction accompanied by nuclear breakup in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) , and in peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In the latter, hundreds of particles can be created. This writeup will explore this paradox, and also present an alternate, semi-classical approach toward coherent production: adding the amplitudes with an appropriate propagator. The semi-classical approach explains the transverse momentum dependence of exclusive vector meson production in UPCs, but does not address the target final state.

       "  'Resumen': 'The fusion/capture cross sections (CSs) of complex nuclei (heavy ions) are often described in the literature within two approaches: i) the coupled channels model accounting for structure of the colliding nuclei and ii) trajectory models with friction and thermal fluctuations (dissipative effects). The first approach does not account for friction whereas the second one is not able to deal with sub-barrier CSs. In the present work, we have developed an algorithm for calculating the capture CSs of collision of spherical nuclei accounting for both zero-point oscillations (ZPO) of the nuclear shapes (structure effects) and for dissipative effects; i.e., in a sense we have combined the above two approaches. The bare nucleus-nucleus potential is evaluated using the semi-microscopic double-folding model with M3Y-Paris nucleon-nucleon forces. The nucleon densities are taken from the IAEA data base. For each collision partner several deformations of quadrupole and octupole type are accounted for with the probabilities corresponding to the harmonic oscillator at the ground state. The dissipative effects enter into our combined approach within the surface friction model well known in the literature. The final fate of a trajectory is decided by means of quantum transmission coefficients. There are two fitting parameters in the model, tau and K_R. Parameter tau reflects to what extent ZPO survives when the reagents approach each other. Parameter K_R is the friction strength for the radial motion. All calculations have been performed for 16O+92Zr reaction. The calculated CSs and barrier distribution are found in good agreement with the precision experimental data at reasonable values of tau and K_R. Calculations show that the CSs are mostly sensitive to tau at low (sub-barrier) collision energies whereas the value of K_R is important at the above barrier energies.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'Recent experimental results on the Lambda_c/D^0 ratio in proton-proton collisions have revealed a significant enhancement compared to expectations based on universal fragmentation fractions/functions across different colliding systems, from e+e- to pp. This unexpected enhancement has sparked speculation about the potential effects of a deconfined medium impacting hadronization, previously considered exclusive to heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that assumes the formation of a small, deconfined, and expanding fireball even in pp collisions, where charm quarks can undergo rescattering and hadronization. We make use of the same in-medium hadronization mechanism developed for heavy-ion collisions, which involves local color-neutralization through recombination of charm quarks with nearby opposite color charges from the background fireball. Our model incorporates the presence of diquark excitations in the hot medium, which promotes the formation of charmed baryons. Moreover, the recombination process, involving closely aligned partons from the same fluid cell, effectively transfers the collective flow of the system to the final charmed hadrons. We show that this framework can qualitatively reproduce the observed experimental findings in heavy-flavor particle-yield ratios, $p_T$-spectra and elliptic-flow coefficients. Our results provide new, complementary supporting evidence that the collective phenomena observed in small systems naturally have the same origin as those observed in heavy-ion collisions\\n‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The calculated results were compared with the INDRA and FOPI experimental data.

In this work, we employ equilibrium lattice simulations of the underlying theory, QCD, involving similar inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles to achieve a better understanding of this system. We simulate three flavors of dynamical staggered quarks with physical masses at a range of magnetic fields and temperatures, and extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. Analyzing the impact of the field on the quark condensate and the Polyakov loop, we find non-trivial spatial features that render the QCD medium qualitatively different as in the homogeneous setup, especially at temperatures around the transition. In addition, we construct leading-order chiral perturbation theory for the inhomogeneous background and compare its prediction to our lattice results at low temperature. Our findings will be useful to benchmark effective theories and low-energy models of QCD for a better description of peripheral heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': '$Œ£$ is a new correlation measure, quite recently introduced to heavy-ion physics. This measure, defined in the independent source model as a strongly intensive quantity, is expected to be free of the effects of system volume and volume fluctuations. This paper discusses the forward-backward correlation quantified with the $Œ£$ observable calculated in the framework of the wounded nucleon model (WNM) and wounded quark model (WQM). Findings show that the wounded constituent approach outperforms the commonly used heavy-ion Monte Carlo generators, such as HIJING, AMPT or EPOS, by accurately describing the experimental data on FB correlations with $Œ£$ measured by ALICE in Xe--Xe reactions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm{NN}}}$=5.44 TeV and in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_{\\\\rm{NN}}}$= 2.76 and 5.02 TeV. This paper demonstrates that $Œ£$ can be a unique tool for determining the fragmentation function of a wounded constituent in a symmetric nucleus-nucleus collision.

The quark-meson coupling (QMC) model is employed to describe the in-medium baryon properties that are constructed at the quark level, such as the nucleon and $Œî$ masses, and $Œî$ full decay width. I reproduce the experimental data of the cross-section in a vacuum as a justification of our approach and then analyze the in-medium total and differential cross-sections as well as proton-spin asymmetry. Following the results of the in-medium elastic $œÄN$ scattering calculation, the elastic $œÄA$ scattering is investigated at finite baryon density in the framework of the Eikonal Glauber model for the light nuclei, $^4\\\\mathrm{He}$ and $^{12}\\\\mathrm{C}$. For the description of the finite nuclei, the Wood-Saxon density profile, and an expansion of the charge distribution as a sum of Gaussians are employed in this study.

The results show that the effective baryon mass and cross-sections in the medium decrease as density increases except for the $Œî$ decay width, which increases as the density increases. The elastic $œÄA$ scattering at the tree-level Born approximation reproduces well the experimental data for $^4\\\\mathrm{He}$ but overestimates for $^{12}\\\\mathrm{C}$.

Compared to prior OQS+pNRQCD studies we include the rapidity dependence of bottomonium production and evolution, allowing for a fully 3-dimensional description of bottomonium trajectories in the quark-gluon plasma. The underlying formalism used to compute the ground and excited state survival probabilities is based on a Lindblad equation that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the binding energy over temperature. For the background evolution, we make use of a 3+1D viscous hydrodynamics code which reproduces soft hadron observables at all three collision energies. We find good agreement between NLO OQS+pNRQCD predictions and data taken at LHC energies, however, at RHIC energies, there is tension with recent bottomonium suppression measurements by the STAR collaboration.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The bottomonia production process is proving to be one of the most robust processes to investigate the fundamental aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics at both low and high temperatures. The LHC experiments in the last decade have produced large statistics of bottomonia states in wide kinematic ranges in various collision systems. The bottomonia have three $Œ•$ S-states which are reconstructed in dilepton invariant mass channel with high mass resolution by LHC detectors and P-states are measured via their decay to S-states. We start with the details of measurements in proton+proton collisions and their understanding in terms of various effective theoretical models. Here we cover both the Tevatron and LHC measurements with $\\\\sqrt{s}$ spanning from 1.8 TeV to 13 TeV. The bottomonia states have particularly been very good probes to understand strongly interacting matter produced in heavy-ion collisions. The Pb+Pb collisions have been performed at $\\\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV at LHC. This led to the detailed study of the modification of bottomonia yields as a function of various observables and collision energy. At the same time, the improved results of bottomonia production became available from RHIC experiments which have proven to be useful for a quantitative comparison. A systematic study of bottomonia production in p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb has been very useful to understand the medium effects in these collision systems. We review some of the (if not all the) models of bottomonia evolution due to various processes in a large dynamically evolving medium and discuss these in comparison with the measurements.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

Despite the strong polarization of the produced $Œõ$s and $\\\\overlineŒõ$s induced by the vortical flows in the medium, the observed polarization signal is significantly depleted because of the feed down from weak and electromagnetic decays of heavier hyperons. Particularly strong suppression is found to be due to electromagnetic decays of $Œ£^0$ hyperons, which multiplicities obtained in the transport are poorly constrained both from the microscopic input of the $Œ£^0$ production reactions and from the experimental data. The final $Œõ(\\\\overlineŒõ)$ polarization signal strongly depends on the $Œ£^0$ multiplicity generated in the model.

Using the effective range expansion, we classify the nature of the pole of the near-threshold eigenstate in terms of the scattering length, in the presence of the decay channel. It is shown that the quasibound state below the threshold can be described by only the scattering length, while the description of the resonance above the threshold requires the contribution from the effective range. Based on the chiral unitary approach, we construct a theoretical model which generates the pole of $Œû(1620)$ below the $\\\\bar{K}Œõ$ threshold with relatively narrow width, as reported by the Belle collaboration. It is quantitatively demonstrated that the spectrum of the $Œû(1620)$ quasibound state is distorted by the effect of the nearby $\\\\bar{K}Œõ$ threshold. We then construct another model which reproduces the $K^{-}Œõ$ scattering length by the ALICE collaboration.

We employ the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, in order to delineate chiral properties of the diquarks, in particular, the mass degeneracy of chiral partners under extreme conditions. We focus on the effects of $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly on manifestation of the chiral-partner structures. We find that, in the absence of anomaly effects to the diquarks, the mass degeneracies in all $[ud]$, $[su]$ and $[sd]$ diquark sectors take place prominently above the pseudocritical temperature of the chiral restoration. On the other hand, the anomaly effects are found to hinder the $[ud]$ diquark from exhibiting the mass degeneracy, accompanied by a slow reduction of the $\\\\bar{s}s$ condensate, while the $[su]$ and $[sd]$ diquarks are not much affected.

Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha and Kovtun (BDNK) recently derived a causal, locally well-posed, and modally stable relativistic fluid model that incorporates the effects of viscosity and heat diffusion. We study the non-relativistic limit of this fluid model and show that causality for relativistic motion restricts the transport coefficients in the non-relativistic limit. This restriction provides an upper bound on the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density for fluids that can be described as relativistic within the BDNK model and can be exactly modeled using the Navier-Stokes equation in the non-relativistic limit. Furthermore, we show that the Fourier law of heat conduction must be modified by higher gradient corrections for such fluids. We also show that the non-relativistic limit of the BDNK equations of motion are never hyperbolic, in contrast to the non-relativistic limit of extended variable models, whose non-relativistic equations of motion can be hyperbolic or not depending on the scaling of the transport coefficients present in the auxiliary equations for viscous degrees of freedom.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

Our analysis does not take into account potential kinetic effects, specifically, anomalous coupling through plasma microturbulence, that can significantly reduce the velocity spread downstream, below the activation energy for nuclear reactions. A rough estimate of the scale separation in RMS suggests that for shocks propagating in BNS merger ejecta, the anomalous coupling length may exceed the radiation length, allowing a considerable composition change behind the shock via inelastic collisions of $Œ±$ particles with heavy elements at shock velocities $Œ≤_u\\\\gtrsim0.2$. Moreover, a sufficient abundance of free neutrons upstream of the shock can also trigger fission through neutron capture reactions downstream.

Yet the heavy-ion capture cross sections are calculated theoretically with significant uncertainties. In particular, these cross sections below the barrier sometimes underestimate the experimental ones by orders of magnitude. In the literature, it had been shown that accounting for the Zero-Point Oscillations (ZPO) of the shape of colliding nuclei increased significantly the calculated capture cross sections. However, those calculations had been performed in a simplified way with a schematic nucleus-nucleus potential and for few reactions. The purpose of the present paper is to account for the ZPO in a more realistic way and to compare systematically the resulting capture cross sections with the experimental data. In the present paper, the nucleus-nucleus potential is evaluated using the semi-microscopical double-folding model with M3Y-Paris nucleon-nucleon forces. The nucleon densities needed for finding this potential are generated from the experimental three-parameter Fermi charge densities. The calculated capture cross sections are compared with the data for reactions 16O+54Fe, 58Ni, 144Nd, 148Sm, and 58Ni+54Fe, 58Ni, 60Ni.

We found about three order of magnitude increase in the production of $Œ©_{ccc}$ in Pb-Pb collisions compared with the yield in small collision systems like OO collisions. Furthermore, we investigate the effects on the $Œ©_{ccc}$ particle production and spectra coming from the modification of the charm quark distribution due to the different size of the collision systems and also in the case of charm thermal distributions.

We also include the Mott effect on light nuclei, i.e., a light nucleus would no longer be bound if the phase-space density of its surrounding nucleons is too large. With this kinetic approach, we obtain a reasonable description of the measured yields of light nuclei in central Au+Au collisions at energies of $0.25$ - $1.0A~\\\\rm GeV$ by the FOPI collaboration. Our study also indicates that the observed enhancement of the $Œ±$-particle yield at low incident energies can be attributed to a weaker Mott effect on the $Œ±$-particle, which makes it more difficult to dissolve in nuclear medium, as a result of its much larger binding energy.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'One of the long-standing problems in the field of high-energy heavy-ion collisions is that the dynamical models based on viscous hydrodynamics fail to describe the experimental elliptic flow $v_2$ and the triangular flow $v_3$ simultaneously in ultra-central collisions. The problem, known as the \"ultra-central flow puzzle\", is specifically that hydrodynamics-based models predict the flow ratio of the two-particle cumulant method $v_2\\\\{2\\\\}/v_3\\\\{2\\\\} > 1$ while $v_2\\\\{2\\\\}/v_3\\\\{2\\\\} \\\\sim 1$ in the experimental data. In this Letter, we focus on the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations during the space-time evolution of the QGP fluid on the flow observables in the ultra-central collisions. Using the (3+1)-dimensional integrated dynamical model which includes relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics, we analyze the anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n\\\\{2\\\\}$ in 0-0.2% central Pb+Pb collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s_\\\\text{NN}}=2.76~\\\\text{TeV}$. We find that the hydrodynamic fluctuations decrease the model overestimate of $v_2\\\\{2\\\\}/v_3\\\\{2\\\\}$ from the experimental data by about 19% within the present setup of $Œ∑/s = 1/2œÄ$. This means that the hydrodynamic fluctuations qualitatively have an effect to improve the situation for the puzzle, but the effect of the hydrodynamic fluctuations alone is quantitatively insufficient to resolve the puzzle. The decrease of the ratio largely depends on the shear viscosity $Œ∑/s$, which calls for future comprehensive analyses with, for example, a realistic temperature-dependent viscosity.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The nucleus-nucleus interaction potential is calculated using the double-folding model (DFM) with the M3Y Paris NN forces. The nucleon densities entering the model are generated from the experimental three-parameter Fermi charge densities. The DFM has been extended to the case of deformed target nuclei. It is shown that the density-dependent M3Y NN forces with the finite range exchange part can be mimicked successfully by the zero-range density-independent forces. The latter option significantly reduces the required computer time. For the nucleon densities and target nuclei deformations we employ the values from the commonly used data bases. Thus, we do not vary any parameters to reach a better agreement with the data. The resulting cross-sections are compared with data for 20 reactions with the product of the charge numbers Z_P*Z_T ranging from 216 up to 2576. We discuss the opinion met in the literature that the M3Y NN forces provide a poorer description of the capture cross-sections in heavy-ion collisions in comparison to the NN forces coming from the relativistic mean-field approach. Our calculations show that the M3Y NN forces give an agreement with the data which is not perfect yet is not worse than the one resulting from the RMF NN forces.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'In the present paper, we study the uncertainties in modeling the collision of complex nuclei (heavy ions) resulting in capture of the nuclei into orbital motion. The effective interaction energy of the nuclei (effective potential) consists of three terms: the Coulomb potential, the strong nucleus-nucleus potential, and the centrifugal term related to the orbital motion. The last term usually is considered in the literature as the simplest one. However, we found in the literature at least two different approaches for the centrifugal potential. To see the effect of using these different prescriptions, we evaluate the capture cross sections using the standard quantum-mechanical formula with the transmission coefficients calculated within the quasi-classical approximation. For the Coulomb- and strong nuclear terms we apply the semi-microscopical double-folding model with the effective nucleon-nucleon forces of Yukawa type. For the nucleon densities the two parameter Fermi formula is used with the parameters from the IAEA data base. Our calculations show that the two approaches for the centrifugal potential result in theoretical capture cross sections which are 20-40 percent different. This result holds for any collision energies.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The DL models did remarkably well in predicting $N_{\\\\mathrm{part}}$ values with CNN slightly outperforming the DNN model. The Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE) for the CNN model (Model-4) is determined to be 0.0592 for minimum bias collisions and 0.0114 for 0-60\\\\% centrality class, indicating that the model performs better for semi-central and central collisions.

An anti-correlation between proton and deuteron multiplicity is observed across all collision energies and centralities, consistent with the expectation from global baryon number conservation. The UrQMD model coupled with a phase-space coalescence mechanism qualitatively reproduces the collision-energy dependence of cumulant ratios and proton-deuteron correlations.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'We develop the first event generator, the electron-Heavy-Ion-Jet-Interaction-Generator (eHIJING), for the jet tomography study of electron-ion collisions. In this generator, energetic jet partons produced from the initial hard scattering undergo multiple collisions with the nuclear remnants with a collision rate that is proportional to the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) gluon densities in the nucleus. Medium-modified QCD parton splittings within the higher-twist and generalized higher-twist framework are utilized to simulate parton showering in the nuclear medium that takes into account the non-Abelian Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal interference in gluon radiation induced by multiple scatterings. The TMD gluon distribution inside the nucleus is given by a simple model inspired by the physics of gluon saturation. Employing eHIJING, we revisit hadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) as measured by EMC, HERMES as well as recent CLAS experiments. eHIJING with both the higher-twist and generalized higher-twist framework gives reasonably good descriptions of these experimental data. Predictions for experiments at the future electron-ion colliders are also provided. It is demonstrated that future measurements of the transverse momentum broadening of single hadron spectra can be used to map out the two dimensional kinematic ($Q^2, x_B$) dependence the jet transport parameter $\\\\hat{q}$ in cold nuclear matter.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The values of the correlation coefficients illustrate that the magnitude of the effective mass splitting is crucial for the tight constraints of the symmetry energy via HICs.

       "  'Resumen': 'Global polarizations ($P$) of $Œõ$ ($\\\\barŒõ$) hyperons have been observed in non-central heavy-ion collisions. The strong magnetic field primarily created by the spectator protons in such collisions would split the $Œõ$ and $\\\\barŒõ$ global polarizations ($ŒîP = P_Œõ - P_{\\\\barŒõ} < 0$). Additionally, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts topological charge fluctuations in vacuum, resulting in a chirality imbalance or parity violation in a local domain. This would give rise to an imbalance ($Œîn = \\\\frac{N_{\\\\text{L}} - N_{\\\\text{R}}}{\\\\langle N_{\\\\text{L}} + N_{\\\\text{R}} \\\\rangle} \\\\neq 0$) between left- and right-handed $Œõ$ ($\\\\barŒõ$) as well as a charge separation along the magnetic field, referred to as the chiral magnetic effect (CME). This charge separation can be characterized by the parity-even azimuthal correlator ($ŒîŒ≥$) and parity-odd azimuthal harmonic observable ($Œîa_{1}$). Measurements of $ŒîP$, $ŒîŒ≥$, and $Œîa_{1}$ have not led to definitive conclusions concerning the CME or the magnetic field, and $Œîn$ has not been measured previously. Correlations among these observables may reveal new insights. This paper reports measurements of correlation between $Œîn$ and $Œîa_{1}$, which is sensitive to chirality fluctuations, and correlation between $ŒîP$ and $ŒîŒ≥$ sensitive to magnetic field in Au+Au collisions at 27 GeV. For both measurements, no correlations have been observed beyond statistical fluctuations.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The L√©vy scale parameter R(mT) decreases with mT and exhibits a clear centrality ordering which supports its geometrical interpretation. The L√©vy exponent Œ±(mT) is independent of mT in every centrality bin but shows some centrality dependence. At all centralities Œ± is significantly different from that of a Gaussian (Œ± = 2) or Cauchy (Œ± = 1) source distribution. The L√©vy strength parameter Œª was also investigated. We observed that Œª(mT) decreases at low mT and saturates around mT = 0.6 GeV/c2.

       "  'Resumen': 'The hard-scatter processes in hadronic collisions are often largely contaminated with soft background coming from pileup in proton-proton collisions, or underlying event in heavy-ion collisions. There are multiple methods to remove the effect of pileup for jets. Two such methods, Area Subtraction and Constituent Subtraction, use the pileup density as the main ingredient to estimate the magnitude of pileup contribution on an event-by-event basis. The state-of-the-art approaches to estimating pileup density are sensitive to the number of hard-scatter jets in the event. This paper presents a new pileup-density estimation method that minimizes the sensitivity on the presence of hard-scatter jets in the event. Using a detector-level simulation, we provide a comparison of the new method with the state-of-the-art estimation methods. We observe a significantly lower bias for the estimated pileup density when using the new method. We conclude that the new method has the potential to significantly improve pileup mitigation in proton-proton collisions or the underlying event subtraction in heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

Assuming jet energy loss is proportional to the initial parton density $œÅ\\\\sim dN_{\\\\rm ch}/dŒ∑/œÄR_{\\\\rm eff}^2$ as estimated from the pseudorapidity density of charged hadron multiplicity $dN_{\\\\rm ch}/dŒ∑$ and the effective system size $R_{\\\\rm eff}\\\\sim N_{\\\\rm part}^{1/3}$ given by the number of participant nucleons $N_{\\\\rm part}$, the scaled average jet energy loss $\\\\langle ŒîE\\\\rangle/œÅ\\\\sim R_{\\\\rm eff}^{0.59} p_T^{0.13}\\\\ln p_T $ for jet cone-size $R=0.4$ is found to have a momentum dependence that is slightly stronger than a logarithmic form while the system size or length dependence is slower than a linear one.

Our study is based on the quantum kinetic theory of spinning quarks and antiquarks and incorporates the relaxation of the dynamically generated spin polarization. The spin density matrix of vector mesons is obtained by quark coalescence via the Wigner function and kinetic equation. Our approach predicts a local spin correlation that is distinct from the non-local expressions previously obtained in phenomenological derivations. We estimate the magnitude of such local correlations in the glasma model of the preequilibrium phase of relativistic heavy ion collisions. It is found that the resulting spin alignment could be greatly enhanced and may be comparable to the experimental measurement in order of magnitude.

Here, our primary focus is on the equilibrium phase, {\\\\it i.e.,} the quark-gluon plasma phase of the created medium to provide a comparative study of energy loss of heavy quarks precisely through the medium polarization, elastic collisions, and radiation as in most of the studies the medium polarization is missing which we found to provide a substantial contribution, especially at low momentum. Hence, we presented the formalism of the energy loss and drag effect for each case and then obtained the nuclear modification factor to provide a comparative study of the three processes.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

The clusters are recognized by the Wigner phase-space density approach at the stage of freeze out in nuclear collisions, i.e., deuteron, triton, $^{3}$He and $Œ±$. The directed and elliptic flows of protons and deuterons in the reaction of $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au at incident energy 1.23\\\\emph{A} GeV are nicely consistent with the recent HADES data. The higher order collective flows, i.e., triangular and quadrangle flows, manifest the opposite trends with the less amplitude in comparison with the rapidity distributions of directed and elliptic flows. The flow structure of $^{3}$He and $Œ±$ is very similar to the proton spectra. The influence of the pion potential on the pion production is systematically investigated and compared with the FOPI data via the transverse momentum, longitudinal rapidity and collective flows in collisions of $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au. It is manifested that the pion yields are slightly suppressed in the domain of mid-rapidity and high momentum. The antiflow phenomena is reduced by implementing the pion potential and more consistent with the FOPI data in collisions of $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au at the incident energy 1.5\\\\emph{A} GeV.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

In particular, particles and anti-particles with opposite charges will receive opposite contributions to their rapidity-odd directed flow, $v_1(\\\\mathsf{y})$.

The combined dependence of the $v_1$ signal on collision system, particle species, and collision centrality can be qualitatively and semi-quantitatively understood as several effects on constituent quarks. While the results in central events can be explained by the $u$ and $d$ quarks transported from initial-state nuclei, those in peripheral events reveal the contributions from the Faraday induction and Coulomb effect for the first time in heavy-ion collisions.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'In the last decade a Quasi-Particle Model (QPM) has been developed to study charm quark dynamics in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions supplying a satisfactory description of the main observables for $D$ meson and providing an estimate of the space-diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$ from the phenomenology. In this paper, we extend the approach to bottom quarks describing their propagation in the quark-gluon plasma within an event-by-event full Boltzmann transport approach followed by a coalescence plus fragmentation hadronization. We find that QPM approach is able to correctly predict the first available data on $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_{2}(p_T)$ of single-electron from B decays without any parameter modification w.r.t. the charm. We show also predictions for centralities where data are not yet available for both $v_{2}(p_T)$ and $v_{3}(p_T)$. Moreover, we discuss the significant breaking of the expected scaling of the thermalization time $œÑ_{th}$ with $M_Q/T$, discussing the evolution with mass of $D_s(T)$ to better assess the comparison to lQCD calculations. We find that at $T=T_c$ charm quark $D_s(T)$ is about a factor of 2 larger than the asymptotic value for $M \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$, while bottom $D_s(T)$ is only a $20-25\\\\%$ higher. This implies a $D_{s}(T)$ which is consistent within the current uncertainty to the most recent lattice QCD calculations with dynamical quarks for $M \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'The Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External-target Experiment (CEE) at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL), China, is the first multi-purpose nuclear physics experimental device to operate in the Giga electron-volt (GeV) energy range. The primary goals of the CEE are to study the bulk properties of dense matter and to understand the quantum chromo-dynamic (QCD) phase diagram by measuring the charged particles produced in heavy-ion collisions in the target region with a large acceptance. The CEE is a spectrometer that focuses on charged final-state particle measurements running on the HIRFL-CSR. The time-of-flight (TOF) system is critical for identifying charged particles in the GeV energy region. In the CEE spectrometer, the TOF system consists of three parts: T0, internal TOF, and external TOF, which are used for the final-state particle identification. The T0 detector provides a high-precision start time for the TOF system by measuring the crossing time of the heavy ion beam. This study details the design, performance simulation, and performance testing of the T0 detector. The simulation results and heavy-ion beam test show that the T0 detector prototype has an excellent time resolution, which is better than 30 ps, and fulfills the requirements of the CEE.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'An approach to identify medium-mass ejectiles from peripheral heavy-ion reactions in the energy region of 15 MeV/nucleon is developed for data obtained with a large acceptance magnetic spectrometer. This spectrometer is equipped with a focal plane multidetector, providing position, angle, energy loss and residual energy of the ions along with measurement of the time-of-flight. Ion trajectory reconstruction is performed at high order and ion mass is obtained with a resolution of better than 1/150. For the unambiguous particle identification however, the reconstruction of both the atomic number Z and the ionic charge q of the ions is critical and it is suggested, within this work, to be performed prior to mass identification. The new proposed method was successfully applied to MAGNEX spectrometer data, for identifying neutron-rich ejectiles related to multinucleon transfer generated in the 70Zn+ 64Ni collision at 15 MeV/nucleon. This approach opens up the possibility of employing heavy-ion reactions with medium-mass beams below the Fermi energy (i.e., in the region 15-25 MeV/nucleon) in conjunction with large acceptance ray tracing spectrometers, first, to study the mechanism(s) of nucleon transfer in these reactions and, second, to produce and study very neutron-rich or even new nuclides in previously unexplored regions of the nuclear landscape.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, event-by-event fluctuations are known to have non-trivial implications. Even though the probability distribution is geometrically isotropic for the initial conditions, the anisotropic $\\\\varepsilon_n$ still differs from zero owing to the statistical fluctuations in the energy profile. On the other hand, the flow harmonics extracted from the hadron spectrum using the multi-particle correlators are inevitably subjected to non-vanishing variance due to the finite number of hadrons emitted in individual events. As one aims to extract information on the fluctuations in the initial conditions via flow harmonics and their fluctuations, finite multiplicity may play a role in interfering with such an effort. In this study, we explore the properties and impacts of such fluctuations in the initial and final states, which both notably appear to be statistical ones originating from the finite number of quanta of the underlying system. We elaborate on the properties of the initial-state eccentricities for the smooth and event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions and their distinct impacts on the resulting flow harmonics. Numerical simulations are performed. The possible implications of the present study are also addressed.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

       "  'Resumen': 'Indicators that illustrate the formation of a strongly interacting thermalized matter of partons have been observed in high-multiplicity proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Strangeness enhancement in such ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is considered to be a consequence of this thermalized phase, known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Simultaneously, proper modeling of hadronic energy fraction in interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) has been proposed as a solution for the muon puzzle. These interactions have center-of-mass collision energies in the order of LHC or higher, indicating that the possibility of a thermalized partonic state cannot be overlooked in UHECR-air interactions. This work investigates the hadronic energy fraction and strangeness enhancement to explore QGP-like phenomena in UHECR-air interactions using various high-energy hadronic models. A thermalized system with statistical hadronization is considered through the EPOS LHC model, while PYTHIA 8, QGSJET II-04, and SYBILL 2.3d consider string fragmentation in the absence of any thermalization. We have found that EPOS LHC gives a better description of strangeness enhancement as compared to other models.

Within the PCQMF model, we use the scalar and vector field values in mean-field approximation to obtain the thermodynamic properties: pressure density, entropy density and energy density. The susceptibilities of conserved charges for strongly interacting matter for different system sizes as well as for different values of the magnetic field have been studied. A sizable shift in phase boundary towards the higher values of quark chemical potential ($Œº_q$) and temperature (T) has been observed for decreasing values of system volume as well as an opposite shift towards lower temperature and quark chemical potential for increasing magnetic field.

       "  'Resumen': 'High-$p_T$ jets are an important tool for characterizing the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. However, a precise understanding of the jet-medium interaction is still lacking, and the development of more sophisticated observables is needed. This work presents a tool that allows for the exploration of alternative high-$p_T$ observables in a variety of collision systems. The tool builds on the publicly available JEWEL Monte Carlo code, and allows for the evolution of a jet on any given (2+1)-dimensional background. Proof-of-concept observables are also presented, studied using the latest version of JEWEL, JEWEL-2.4.0. The simplicity of the separation of the physics of the jet from the physics of the medium (while still allowing for the usual JEWEL medium-response), allows for easy interpretation without the need for complex parameterization. Results are produced using the RIVET toolkit, which allows for transparent preservation and development of analyses that are compatible with experimental methods. The code and analysis used to produce the plots presented here are made publicly available on a Github repository, with up-to-date usage instructions. This tool is expected to be useful to the broad jet-physics community for the study of precision observables for jets.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

By numerically solving the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation within the relaxation time approximation, we explicitly show that magnetic field can affect the characteristics of energy density fluctuations at the timescale the system achieves local thermodynamic equilibrium. A detailed momentum mode analysis of fluctuations reveals that magnetic field increases the damping of mode oscillations, especially for the low momentum modes. This leads to a reduction in the ultraviolet (high momentum) cutoff of fluctuations and also slows down the dissipation of relatively low momentum fluctuation modes.

Performing extensive Ehrenfest MD simulations of the process of proton irradiation of water ice that accurately describe not only the non-adiabatic dynamics of the electrons but also of the nuclei, we have found a stopping mechanism involving the interplay of the electronic and nuclear subsystems. This effect, which consists in a kinetic energy transfer from the projectile to the target nuclei thanks to the perturbations of the electronic density caused by the irradiation, is fundamentally different from the atomic displacements and collision cascades characteristic of nuclear stopping. Moreover, it shows a marked isotopic effect depending on the composition of the target, being relevant mostly for light water as opposed to heavy water.

       "  'Resumen': 'We employ the Boltzmann transport model to study the charmonium regeneration with non-thermal charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. As heavy quarks do not reach kinetic thermalization in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the final transverse momentum distribution of regenerated charmonium depends on the degree of charm quark kinetic thermalization. When the charm momentum distribution becomes harder, more charm quarks are distributed in the middle and high $p_T$, where the production of regenerated charmonium also becomes larger. With non-thermal momentum distribution of charm quarks in their coalescence process, the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of charmonium enhances at middle $p_T$. Besides, the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ of charmonium also enhances at middle $p_T$ as more regenerated charmonium are distributed in this $p_T$ region. The theoretical calculations with non-thermal charm distribution explain well the $p_T$ dependence of charmonium $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$, which indicates that charm quarks do not reach complete kinetic thermalization in the QGP when charmonium are regenerated.\\n        ‚ñ≥ Less'},\n",

We investigate how the new impact parameter constraint influences final states in pp collisions, and retune parameters of the multi-parton interaction parameters in PYTHIA to compensate so that minimum bias data are reproduced. We also study multiplicity distributions in pA collisions and find that, in order to counteract the loss in multiplicity due to the introduction of global colour reconnections, we need to modify some parameters in the Angantyr model while keeping the parameters tuned to pp fixed.
